  summary: >
    <p>Every February, Uruguayan citizens are given the opportunity to choose whether to change or stay with their existing health care provider. In the country’s mixed public-private health care system, several factors come into play when making this decision: the location of the health provider, number of doctors and pediatricians available, hours open, etc. How can Uruguayan citizens make data-driven, informed decisions on choosing health care providers? Datos Abiertos, Transparencia y Acceso a la Inform (DATA) Uruguay, an open data civil society organization, partnered with the Uruguayan Ministry of Health to create A Tu Servicio (http://atuservicio.uy), a website providing easily digestible, searchable and visualized infographics based on open government health data. The Web platform allows users to select their location and then to compare local health care providers based on a wide range of parameters and indicators, such as facility type, medical specialty, care goals, wait times and patient rights. A Tu Servicio has introduced a new paradigm of patient choice into Uruguay’s health care sector, enabling citizens not only to navigate through a range of options but also generating a healthy and informed debate on how more generally to improve the country’s health care sector.</p>
  takeaways: >
    <p><b>Key Takeaways:</b></p>
    <ul class="small"><li>Open data initiatives, including but not limited to those focused in health care, stand to benefit greatly from collaboration between intermediaries – including civil society, the media and, in this case, health care data providers – and government. </li></ul>
    <li>While increasing access to information is an important first step in efforts to unlock the value of open data, simply making information available is not sufficient: information needs to be standardized, machine-readable and visualizable to be truly useful to citizens. </li>
    <li>Successful open data projects have viral potential and can quickly spread to other sectors and applications, or be replicated in other countries.</li></ul>

  background: >
    <p>With an Internet penetration rate of 60.5 percent,  Uruguay is considered an “emerging and advancing” country, according to the Open Data Barometer.  Uruguay has been a member of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) since 2011, and is ranked 12th on the Open Knowledge Foundation’s Global Open Data Index, making it one of the more advanced open data countries in Latin America.  National data from a variety of units and agencies is made available for reuse through the national open data portal (http://www.agesic.gub.uy/), led by AGESIC, the national agency for eGovernment. While recognizing the “great potential” for Uruguay to innovate around open data, the Sunlight Foundation noted recently that many challenges lie ahead for the country as it seeks to transform open data efforts into a mainstream, sustainable government practice.  Despite these challenges, the case study below illustrates the emerging impact of Uruguay’s opening up of government data.</p>
    <p>Health care in Uruguay is delivered through a mixed public-private framework, with private insurers and hospitals working alongside a public health care infrastructure. Citizens can choose their health care service providers. Once an individual has been with a service provider for three years, they are eligible to change their provider at the beginning of the following February. Fabrizio Scrollini, chairman of DATA Uruguay, noted that, as a result, the month of February is typically marked by public debate and discussion over the factors that influence citizens to choose (or leave) a provider. He adds that February is also typically marked by heavy advertising on the part of providers, many of whom “encourage citizens to join them and leave others, and even potentially pay” users to switch providers.</p>
    <p>At the time A Tu Servicio (“At Your Service”) was launched in February 2015, the Ministry of Health was starting to experiment with open data, collecting raw data on service quality from every service provider and publishing these and other health data annually. Data management was generally poor, however, with data frequently out of date, and data sharing hampered by incompatible information management systems. Health care data wasn’t available in a format that would allow citizens to make informed decisions. Additionally, according to Daniel Carranza, cofounder of DATA Uruguay, the pressures from competing health providers led citizens to “rely on marketing and advertising campaigns based on opinion rather than actual data.”</p>

    <h5>Figure 1: A Tu Servicio home page</h5>
    <p>First launched as a pilot program in February 2015 by DATA Uruguay and the Ministry of Health, A Tu Servicio is a Web application based on open government data that provides easily digestible, searchable and visualized infographics of key performance indicators such as facility type, available medical specialties, procedures performed, wait times, goals of care, patient rights and human resources. This platform allows users to compare these indicators across all health care providers in the country, enabling users to make well-informed decisions about their health care providers through machine-readable, interoperable and accessible data that was previously unavailable. For example, users can search across public health care providers (such as Medica Uruguaya and CAMCEL) and private providers (such as Blue Cross Blue Shield) in Montevideo and compare data on the cost of birth control, average wait times and patient satisfaction. Such comparisons can allow a citizen to decide whether to stick with his or her current provider or switch to a new one. Enabling this type of comparison was not always easy, however, since, as Scrollini notes, “private providers were the worst in terms of compliance when sending the data to the Ministry.”
    <p><img src="static/img/studies/uruguay-1.png" /></p>
    <h5>Figure 2: A Tu Servicio health service comparisons</h5>
    <p>The project emerged from a public consultation between the government and DATA Uruguay, a volunteer-based civil society organization committed to promoting open data, transparency, and access to information (http://datauy.org/). In 2013, DATA Uruguay had begun working with 180 Ciencia, a journalism portal, to create the application “Temporada de pases”  (“Transfer season”) as part of a public service project to inform and empower citizens considering changing health care providers. The application relied on existing data published by the Ministry of Health; however, that data was generally of poor quality, often available only in closed formats, and included little metadata. The need for more open health care data quickly became apparent. </p>
    <p>Spurred by the evident shortcomings of the “Temporada de pases” application, the Ministry of Health initiated a discussion with Data Uruguay about ways to make more data available to citizens. This discussion, held under the auspices of the ongoing Open Government Partnership (OGP) roundtable discussions about the Alliance for Open Government, soon resulted in a modest government grant (about $13,000) to create a pilot application that later became A Tu Servicio.  DATA Uruguay also won additional funding from Avina Americas, an organization promoting sustainable development,  and the Iniciativa Latinoamericana por los Datos Abiertos (“Latin American Open Data Initiative,” ILDA), a network of organizations seeking to promote research on and use of open data in the region.</p>
    <p>The key role played by DATA Uruguay is one of the most interesting and important aspects of the A Tu Servicio story. It shows the vital function of intermediaries and civil society in promoting open data, facilitating discussions with the state, and nudging government agencies to release more and higher quality data.  </p>
    <p>At the same time, the role of the state itself cannot be underestimated. A Tu Servicio was supported from the outset by the Ministry of Health, whose encouragement and input (including in product design) was deemed critical to the success of the project.  Even after the website was launched, DATA Uruguay and the state acted together in collecting user feedback and instituting improvements. This included working directly with health institutions to defuse their resistance to opening up data for comparison with other providers.  Ultimately, the success and impact of A Tu Servicio (see next section for a discussion of impact) is testament to the importance of inter-sectoral partnership, and particularly collaboration between the state and civil society. </p>
  impact: >
    <p>In this section, we consider some indicators of impact to determine the success of A Tu Servicio. Since the project – initiated in 2015 and scheduled to run until 2020 – is still in its infancy, any measurements of impact should be considered highly preliminary.  </p>
    <p>In measuring impact within and across these targeted beneficiaries, we consider three categories:  </p>
    <h3>Intended beneficiaries of A Tu Servicio</h3>
    <h3>Use and Awareness:</h3>
    <p>In 2014, before the launch of the application, health care provider data made available by the Ministry of Public Health received fewer than 500 downloads. This low uptake was probably due to limited awareness of the availability of data as well as poor data quality.  </p>
    <p>Following its launch, the impact of A Tu Servicio was almost immediately apparent. In the first month alone, the site received approximately 35,000 visits, a number equivalent to 1 percent of the total population of Uruguay.  The average time spent on the platform was five minutes, and visitors accessed on average five pages per visit.   </p>
    <p>The launch of A Tu Servicio also increased awareness among Uruguayans regarding the availability of data, and its potential to improve their health care. The application’s launch received widespread media coverage, thanks to a press conference held by DATA Uruguay and the Ministry of Health in which the virtues of the initiative were emphasized. Social media was also employed strategically to disseminate information about the initiative and maintain interest after the launch. Additionally, several unions, including a doctors’ union, endorsed the website, stating the need for more health care information to be made available and accessible.  </p>
    <p>One aspect in particular of A Tu Servicio received considerable press coverage.  Shortly after the launch, journalists and citizens began noticing and drawing attention to long wait times at public hospitals, almost all of which were in contravention of maximum wait times established by the government.  The resulting public and media furor resulted in several hospitals changing their practices, and more generally, led to a vigorous public debate about wait times and quality of care in Uruguay. </p>
    <p>A Tu Servicio has also played an important role in stimulating and facilitating more informed debate within Uruguay’s Parliament about the future of the nation’s health care system. For example, on August 11, 2015, a nationalist deputy leader of Montevideo, Martin Lema, spoke out against proposed reforms to the National Resources Fund (FNR), which protects citizens against extraordinary health care expenses in Uruguay.  In making his case, Lema utilized data from the A Tu Servicio platform to refute the government’s claims that proposed health care reforms would benefit vulnerable populations. He stated that the data showed anyone making this claim was “lying or misinformed.”  Lema also publicly criticized the proposed reforms via social media  and public interviews, where he continued to cite data from the A Tu Servicio platform to back his case. </p>
    <h3>Data Quality:</h3>
    <p>As noted earlier, health provider data previously made available by the government was of poor quality, limiting its usability and citizen interest. A Tu Servicio spurred vast improvements in data quality through increased public scrutiny and demand for machine-readable, interoperable and accessible information.  </p>
    <p>The tool’s user-friendly visualizations helped citizens understand the data in new ways and led to greater public scrutiny and discovery of erroneous data. For the first time, citizens were able to spot errors in the data provided by health providers and, through feedback loops built into the application, request corrections. Instances where health providers had not provided sufficient information were labeled as “not available”; in many cases, citizens could identify such holes in the data and make public requests to the Ministry and private providers for the data to be updated. In addition, the Ministry of Health was able to identify instances where provider data was possibly misrepresented as well as instances where provider data did not agree with crowdsourced user information.  Providers made aware of errors have also been able to submit revised and corrected data. After the platform’s launch, Fabrizio Scrollini recalls, “Many [providers] were willing to update their data and standardize it according to our preferences.”  Overall, the launch of the application led to a new commitment to data quality on the part of providers, citizens and politicians. </p>
    <h3>Impact on Other Open Data Projects:</h3>
    <p>Success often breeds success, and the A Tu Servicio project is a good example of how an effective project in one country and sector can spur positive developments in open data elsewhere. The impact of A Tu Servicio on open data progress can be seen in two ways: in other regional projects encouraged by Uruguay’s example; and in other open data projects within Uruguay itself. </p>
    <p><b>Regional and global impact:/<b> The most direct evidence of A Tu Servicio’s regional spillover is evident in the Mexican state of Sonora, where DATA Uruguay and Codeando Mexico, another Mexican NGO, have been collaborating with a civil society group on the development of a health care data reporting website aiming to promote a standard for health service delivery.  This website, La Rebelion de los Enfermos,  gives citizens the ability to report on hospital incidents and provides them with essential information for filing formal complaints. The focus is on creating data standards and exploring further opportunities to open health care information to the public. DATA Uruguay also presented the platform at the Pan American Health Organization, which has used A Tu Servicio as an example of good practice for other health systems in the region. Following international recognition this project has received (for example, as a finalist in the Open Data Institute’s Open Data Awards),  DATA Uruguay has received interest in creating similar platforms in Europe and Africa.  </p>
    <p><b>National impact:</b> Within Uruguay, too, A Tu Servicio’s success has opened up new possibilities for open data and citizen empowerment through access to information. In the wake of the application’s release, other government ministries and departments have either initiated new open data projects or shown interest in doing so. The impact of A Tu Servicio on other parts of the government is evident at AGESIC, the national eGovernment agency, which is using A Tu Servicio as a “best case” to present to various ministries and other organizations to promote open government and open data.  Additionally, the Ministry of Health has been ramping up its own efforts and commitment to open data, establishing new standards for openness and quality, and publishing new information about how data is collected, stored and made available for reuse. In addition, several new open projects are scheduled to be released between now and 2010.  A Tu Servicio’s national impact is also evidenced by the fact that it survived a change of administration – something that is, as Scrollini puts it, “very unlikely in some polities (including Uruguay).”  </p>
    <p>In the months following the release of A Tu Servicio, the open data movement has continued to pick up steam in Uruguay. At the Open Data Day in Latin America and the Caribbean, a group of developers analyzed open geographical data in order to analyze and visualize the number of streets in Montevideo named after notable women.  Upon coming to the unfortunate conclusion that only 100 out of 5,000 streets in the city are named for women, the group developed an interactive website, Calles de Mujeres, providing citizens with more information on the important contributions these women made to Uruguayan history.  Additionally, the portal located at Datos.gub.uy continues to collect applications and platforms created through the country’s open data, including apps focused on transportation, culture and local history.  </p>
  discussion: >
  action: >
  challenges: >
    <p>A Tu Servicio has been remarkably successful, especially given the limited time since its launch. A number of challenges, however, are still acting as a barrier to greater impact. Two, in particular, are worth examining in some detail. </p>
    <h3>Timing constraints</h3>
    <p>A Tu Servicio’s period of peak usefulness is very short, limited to the month of February (and the weeks immediately preceding), when citizens can change their service providers. If the service is to scale up and attract more users, it needs to overcome two hurdles: </p>
    <ul class="small"><li>Find a way of maximizing exposure and reach during its limited period of peak usefulness. In particular, site administrators need to ensure that the application contains all necessary data during this time and that the application is widely disseminated through media and other channels.</li></ul>
    <li>Find ways of engaging users outside the period of peak usefulness. While citizens may only be able to change providers at a certain time of the year, health concerns and the need for health-related information are not time-bound. Ultimately, A Tu Servicio may be able to establish itself as a more general-purpose health-information portal, one that could be useful throughout the year.</li></ul>
    <h3>Outreach and communication</h3>
    <p>Despite a widely publicized press conference and several mentions in the national media, the outreach campaign for A Tu Servicio was in fact rather hasty and somewhat ad hoc. Future efforts should not only be more sustained, but also focused on reaching under-served and under-privileged populations. These populations may not only lack access to health care; they are also least likely to be Internet savvy, and thus A Tu Servicio must confront something of a double challenge in reaching out to them. </p>
    <p>In this regard, A Tu Servicio may find it useful to engage and collaborate with intermediaries, both in the media and especially in civil society. A Tu Servicio’s success is itself testament to the power of inter-sectoral collaboration and the powerful part that can be played by civil society. Several other examples included in this series of case studies also offer testament to the ability of intermediaries and civil society groups to spread awareness of new applications and websites, particularly among traditionally underserved groups. A Tu Servicio could apply some of those lessons, spreading its usefulness and expanding the potential of open data beyond the 1 percent of Uruguayans who currently use the application.  </p>
  looking_forward: >
    <p>Since the launch of A Tu Servicio, DATA Uruguay and the Ministry of Health have worked on a number of initiatives and features to improve the platform. These initiatives focus on increasing usability, particularly through the development of a mobile application; creating better feedback mechanisms for incorporating and crowdsourcing user data; and providing a kind of “TripAdvisor” for users to describe and rate their experiences at specific hospitals. Overall, A Tu Servicio is seen as the first step in a broader scheme of projects within the Ministry of Health to disseminate open government health data. For example, the government is also considering disseminating information related to vaccinations more widely.   </p>
    <p>As we see the broad-based adoption of “wearables”, allowing for devices such as smartphones to collect personal data and “quantify oneself,” the possibility of adding a “small data” element to the application may be considered. Small data refers to the practice of collecting individual-level information and then providing that data back to those individuals in a more readily understandable way to improve personal health decision-making. For instance, the application could collect information on an individual’s heart health or glucose levels and then offer that information in a visualized, time-charted way, allowing individuals to track their health and keep chronic conditions under control. This feature is but one of the potential avenues for achieving the broader goal of moving A Tu Servicio towards more of a generalized health information portal. Though, as Scrollini notes, “Uruguay has a very stringent personal data protection law. As a result, the cost of developing [such a small data effort] could be high for a lightweight initiative.”  </p>
    <p>On current planning, A Tu Servicio is scheduled to run until 2020. Given its impact and general popularity, however, there is little doubt that this specific platform, in its current form, represents just the start of a much longer process of transformation and opening up in Uruguay’s health care sector. </p>

  summary: >
    <p>TheyWorkForYou.com is a parliamentary monitoring website that has been running for more than 10 years in the UK. It provides an accessible, searchable version of the official record of proceedings of the UK Parliament, as well as the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly. It also provides analysis of the voting records of elected and non-elected representatives. TheyWorkForYou predates open data reforms in the UK by a number of years, and is included in this report as a window onto the long-term impacts of outputs based on public data. One of TheyWorkForYou’s long-term impacts appears to be encouraging parliamentarians to vote less with their party and more in the interests of the people they represent. It is also important to consider the potential monetised time savings delivered to the site’s users—many of whom are civil society groups and journalists. These might well be in the millions of pounds a year, although methodological constraints mean it will probably always be impossible to put an exact figure on them.</p>
  takeaways: >
    <ul class="small"><li>The greatest impact of TheyWorkForYou may be on Parliamentarians themselves. mySociety suspects, and some data confirms, that Parliamentarians have changed the way they go about their work in response to TheyWorkForYou’s vote monitoring and analysis tools, both by turning up for more votes and rebelling against their party more often.</li></ul>
    <li>Just as TfL’s open data policy saves commuters’ time, TheyWorkForYou.com saves time for its users—many of whom are civil society groups and journalists. As well as expecting websites with a social/political mission to achieve long-term positive social/political impacts by themselves, we can also expect them to save time for people trying to achieve those impacts through other means. </li>
    <li>Although it may look on the face of things like postcodes have nothing to do with Parliamentary monitoring, in fact postcode data is one of the key datasets that drive TheyWorkForYou.com. Early on in the website’s history, mySociety had access to postcode data via a licence from Ordnance Survey. It now uses open data on postcodes provided by Ordnance Survey and the Office for National Statistics. But mySociety’s lack of access to Royal Mail’s Postcode Address File (see page 12) means it cannot deliver accurate information to all its users on who their elected representative is.</li>
    <li>mySociety views maintaining TheyWorkForYou.com as a “residual”, and hence low priority, activity, and now focus most of their work on helping international NGOs. The long-term sustainability of projects like TheyWorkForYou.com is brought into question by this case.</li></ul>

  background: >
    <p>TheyWorkForYou.com provides accessible, searchable data on the members and proceedings of Parliament, the main legislative body of the United Kingdom, as well as the Northern Ireland Assembly. Previous versions of the website also offered information on the members and proceedings of the Scottish Parliament. TheyWorkForYou.com provides a wide range of information, including members’ voting records, speeches, and registered interests. The front page of the website invites users to answer the question “Does Your MP represent you?” by filling in their postcode to access analysis on the way their constituency’s MP votes and see their latest appearances in Parliament (See Figure 9 and Figure 10).</p>

    <p>TheyWorkForYou.com was launched in June 2004 by a group of volunteers “who thought it should be really easy for people to keep tabs on their elected MPs, and their unelected Peers, and comment on what goes on in Parliament”. Individually, the original volunteers had already developed a number of civic-minded websites. Since 2006, TheyWorkForYou.com has been run by mySociety, a nonprofit social enterprise based in the UK that develops web platforms that “give people the power to get things changed”.</p>
    <p>The data that powered TheyWorkForYou.com was scraped from Hansard, the official record of parliamentary proceedings, published on Parliament’s own website. TheyWorkForYou.com launched despite the fact that this activity constituted a copyright infringement: The volunteers did not have the right to reproduce Hansard, which was covered by Crown Copyright. Later on, and in cooperation with some of the TheyWorkForYou.com volunteers, click-use licences were developed at the Office for Public Sector Information (OPSI) which among other things legitimised the site’s activities. </p>
  data: >
    <p>TheyWorkForYou.com uses multiple data sources. When asked about the most important datasets that drive the platform, mySociety’s Matthew Somerville, the site’s lead developer, identifies the following datasets:</p>
    <ol><li><b>Postcode and </b>constituency<b> boundary data</b>, for mapping people to their
    representatives</li>
    <li><b>People</b>, for each of the legislatures covered</li>
    <li><b>Transcript </b>data, for each of the legislatures covered, and
    multiple different types of data in that (e.g., actual debates, written
    answers, future business, committees, etc.)</li></ol>
    <p>He continues:</p>
    <p><blockquote>The vote analyses are important, but are fundamentally just derived
    from the transcript data that includes the voting information. I'd possibly add our own dataset of everyone signed up for email alerts, as the daily emails we send based on information gleaned from the other datasets does presumably help power the site in a way</blockquote><blockquote>.</blockquote></p>
    <p>Over 10-plus years operating TheyWorkForYou.com, Somerville has seen changes in how this data is provided. In terms of <b>postcodes and </b>constituency<b> boundaries</b>, since 2010, TheyWorkForYou.com has been using Ordnance Survey’s CodePoint Open open data product to match people’s postcodes to their constituencies in Great Britain, and the Office for National Statistics’ postcode product to perform the same function for users living in Northern Ireland. The latter source does not conform to the open definition, since it is provided for non-commercial use only. Before these products became available, mySociety had access to postcodes via a licence from Ordnance Survey. </p>
    <p>The <b>people </b>data has been constructed over the years from various data sources, and mySociety makes it available under an open licence. </p>
    <p>The <b>transcript</b> data for the Northern Ireland Assembly is accessed via the assembly’s AIMS open data portal launched by the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2012. Since 2014 the development team of the official UK Parliament website, Parliament.uk, has also been making its data available via API. Despite this, TheyWorkForYou.com still scrapes transcript data from Hansard every morning to populate the site with the latest proceedings of the UK Parliament, rather than access the data via the API. </p>
    <p>Tom Steinberg, outgoing CEO of mySociety, explains that continuing to scrape official websites rather than taking advantage of new open data APIs is mainly down to prioritising resources at mySociety:</p>
    <p><blockquote>If we’ve not used some of it [open data] it’s quite often because the cost of us rewriting the software to use it is just not worth it when we can carry on screen scraping.</blockquote></p>
    <p>The original scraper that provided TheyWorkForYou.com with transcripts of proceedings in the Scottish Parliament was developed by a volunteer, Mark Longair. But for the last couple of years TheyWorkForYou.com’s Scottish site has not been updated. Somerville explains:</p>
    <p><i>[The] Scottish Parliament changed their site a couple of years back and we haven't had time since to update the </i><i>scrape</i><i>r, and not had anyone volunteer to help out, so [it’s not been] updated since then. Don't think they have an </i><i>API</i><i> of any sort as yet.</i></p>
  path_to_impact: >
    <p>TheyWorkForYou.com played a key role in forming the UK’s policy around open data. In 2007 Tom Steinberg was commissioned to co-write an influential review of the opportunities presented by opening up public sector information, a move he says traces directly back to his involvement with TheyWorkForYou.com:</p>
    <p><i>Back in the </i><i>Labour</i><i> era, Number Ten [i.e., the Prime Minister’s office] was willing to talk to us as a group of people because TheyWorkForYou existed. Why were they willing to talk to us? Because they used it, they used it to look up their own parliamentary data and they couldn’t use the </i><i>Parliament</i><i> website at the time because it was too [poorly designed]. And so unarguably TheyWorkForYou was a key to get in through the door of Number Ten. And it led pretty directly to the Power of Information review.</i></p>
    <p>One of the most interesting things about TheyWorkForYou.com is how central postcode data is to its operations. mySociety was part of the range of voices calling on Ordnance Survey to free its data before the 2010 CodePoint Open release, particularly boundary data, which is crucial in identifying a user’s elected representative.</p>
    <p>The way mySociety uses postcode data immediately personalises the experience of using TheyWorkForYou, and lowers the barrier to accessing the workings of democracy in a country where research shows only 22% of people can name their elected representative. This observation underscores the utility of postcodes across a vast range of online applications.</p>
  outcome: >
    <p>Somerville reports that TheyWorkForYou.com sends out around 30,000 emails a day to people who have subscribed to a range of notifications, from when their MP speaks in Parliament to when specific words are mentioned. </p>
    <p>The most recent in-depth research into TheyWorkForYou.com’s user base was published by Tobias Escher of the Oxford Internet Institute in 2011. It showed that the site receives between 200,000 and 300,000 visits every month (see Figure 11—the peaks in May 2009 and May 2010 are respectively due to the MPs’ expenses scandal, when many newspapers published links to MPs’ pages on TheyWorkForYou.com, and the publication of an election quiz that matched voters to Parliamentary candidates based on each of their stated political beliefs, developed by TheyWorkForYou.com volunteers in the run-up to the 2010 elections). </p>

    <p>Escher reports that about half of TheyWorkForYou.com’s audience are regular users, and about one in five use it every month. 30% of respondents to a survey of 903 site users developed by Escher say they use the website for work, and usage patterns concentrated in UK business hours substantiate this. About 2% of visits come from IP addresses that indicate the user is working in the Houses of Parliament, and a further 2-3% indicate the user is working for the government. Workers at the BBC accounted for 0.5% of visits in 2010.</p>

    <p>Tom Steinberg thinks that the site’s impact on elected members is probably greater than on any other of its stakeholders:</p>
    <p><blockquote>I don’t think the political classes have got used to the idea of news or information that sticks. They’re very habituated to the idea that there’s a bad news story today and it’s gone tomorrow. All politicians can cope with that. However, a Wikipedia page or a TheyWorkForYou page … they’re sort of permanent. They mean that if you’re going to go and meet someone who doesn’t know you, in the future, then you have every reason to suspect that that person will find out about you from this. So what these static pages say I believe influences what politicians do</blockquote><blockquote>.</blockquote></p>
    <p>Several anecdotes support the claim that Parliamentarians are becoming increasingly aware of how their activities are reflected on TheyWorkForYou.com. In 2006 <i>The Times </i>newspaper speculated that some MPs were making interventions in House of Commons debates simply to keep their “appearances” tally on TheyWorkForYou.com sufficiently high, an event which prompted mySociety to rethink how it represented MPs’ activity. Steinberg relates a story he heard from someone who once had a meeting with an MP cut short so that the MP could go and vote in the House of Commons. When they asked whether the vote really mattered, the MP replied “They all matter since TheyWorkForYou”. In 2008, Gordon Prentice MP complained to the leader of the House of Commons that TheyWorkForYou.com did not cover MPs’ work on committees and therefore gave a “distorted impression” of the efforts MPs make at Westminster.</p>
    <p>Philip Cowley, Professor of Parliamentary Government at the University of Nottingham, has published data showing that “rebellion” (that is, MPs voting against the party line, or—specific to Cowley’s data—government MPs voting against government policy) is on the up in British politics. An <i>Economist </i>article from 2012 cites this data and argues that vote-tracking websites are part of the reason why, as they allow voters and constituency parties to keep better track of their MPs:</p>
    <p><i>One ringleader of [2011]’s huge </i><i>Conservative</i><i> </i><i>rebellion</i><i> over a referendum on EU membership says that it was “incredibly easy” to persuade MPs to join because they were already under intense pressure from their </i><i>constituency</i><i> associations. Gone are the days when an </i><i>MP</i><i> could vote with the government, then sign a contradictory early-day motion or two to muddy the waters, he adds. These days it is “harder to bluff”.</i></p>
    <p>In recognition of the site’s important accountability role, most of the new resources mySociety now devotes to TheyWorkForYou.com go into improving voting records and voting analysis. A recent grant from the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust saw mySociety add about 60,000 more pages of vote analysis to the site.</p>
    <p>The impact on the site’s other users, be they civil servants, journalists, campaigners, or simply citizens interested in the workings of Parliament, is less visible. But Steinberg does not doubt that it is real:</p>
    <p><blockquote>I have no doubt that in some way [TheyWorkForYou] must oil the wheels of tons and tons of campaign groups and people who are kind of just generally in the political world … if it saves them five minutes here, that’s five minutes they can spend on something else …. However, what I can’t do is say “Here is someone who said ‘I was going to lose my campaign, and then I used TheyWorkForYou and then I won it’”.</blockquote></p>
    <p>For these communities, TheyWorkForYou.com’s impact is probably best understood through the same lens as the impact apps derived from TfL’s data have on London’s commuters: It saves them time. One respondent to Escher’s survey notes:</p>
    <p><i>It is a hundred times easier to search than </i><i>Hansard</i><i> itself. I've spent two hours on </i><i>Hansard</i><i> before coming here and have just found what I want in under a minute.</i></p>
    <p>Crudely, then, one might try and follow Deloitte’s analysis of TfL and assume that 30% of the 200,000-300,000 monthly visits to TheyWorkForYou.com are work-related. If every one of these visits represented a 119 minute time-saving (and since time wasted sitting in traffic can be compared to time wasted looking for something and not finding it) one could use the Department for Transport’s average value of working time (£34.12 per hour) to conclude that mySociety was saving this group of users roughly £5,075,350 worth of time every month, or just under £70 million worth of time each year. Taking a more realistic assumption, say that each visit represented Steinberg’s 5 minute time saving, annual time savings delivered are just over £2.5million.</p>
    <p>The analysis is flawed, of course. Unlike the Deloitte analysis, which takes advantage of TfL’s data on Lost Passenger Hours, we cannot assess how many hours working users of TheyWorkForYou.com might have spent trawling through Hansard and other information sources, not finding what they were looking for. It is included here simply to remind readers that although they may not make great stories, incremental time savings are an important and entirely valid form of impact to consider.</p>
    <p>Third sector users have gone on record in praise of the website. TheyWorkForYou.com’s own FAQs contain a lengthy testimonial from Jo Brodie of Diabetes UK, part of which is reproduced below:</p>
    <p><i>TheyWorkForYou.com</i><i> contributes to my 'current awareness' of what is being said about diabetes and insulin (access to treatment, statistics, etc.) and other related health topics (for example organ transplantation and stem cell research as that's very relevant for diabetes and its complications too). The email alerts and RSS feeds mean the information lands rather helpfully in my intray …. It's a great site—thank you</i><blockquote>.</blockquote></p>
    <p>mySociety’s team also receive private messages of thanks from policy experts, elected and unelected members, third sector workers, and others working in public affairs.</p>
    <p>Escher notes from his survey data that TheyWorkForYou.com is reaching people who don’t usually engage in civic activity:</p>
    <p><blockquote>While there are clearly TheyWorkForYou users who are already politically active and who are also [organised] in groups, the online survey shows that one in five users (21%) has neither been politically active (online and/or offline) within the last year nor been a member of any group and importantly, has got information for the first time on what his or her representatives are doing through the use of TheyWorkForYou</blockquote><blockquote>. </blockquote></p>
    <p>TheyWorkForYou.com has also played a key role in helping other Parliamentary Monitoring Organisations (PMOs) around the world. Three years ago it changed its mission, and it now works internationally to support partners who deploy its technology in countries around the world. The code that runs TheyWorkForYou.com is open source, and has been adapted to create similar websites in New Zealand, Ireland, and Australia. In 2013, working with Kenyan PMO Mzalendo, mySociety released Pombola, a “less-UK centric” codebase that it actively helps PMOs to install in order to deploy parliamentary monitoring websites in their own countries. Pombola is already in use in Ghana, South Africa, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe. </p>
  discussion: >
    <p>TheyWorkForYou.com predates open data reforms in the UK by several years and can in fact be said to have contributed to open data policy’s inception. This case study is included in the report because (although not all its data inputs are strictly open data) it is an example of an “output” project that repurposes public information and that has existed for over a decade. As such, it may provide a window through which to view the more long-term impacts of such public data re-use outputs.</p>
    <p>Indeed, the increase in political rebellion, attributed by experts in part to the increased visibility of MPs’ voting records that TheyWorkForYou.com provides, is a positive indicator that TheyWorkForYou.com is having a long-term impact. If politicians are choosing to serve the people who elect them more, and the party political machinery less, then this is a good outcome for representative democracy.</p>
    <p>Of interest too is the amount of time TheyWorkForYou.com may be saving civil society groups and journalists (and, of course, corporate lobbyists too). The monetised time savings used in this case study should not be relied upon and do not bear repeating, since unlike in the TfL case they are based on speculation about the amount of time such users may have lost in seeking out information elsewhere, and not recorded Lost Passenger Hours. The calculations have rather been included here in order to remind readers that as well as expecting websites with a social/political mission to achieve long-term positive social/political impacts by themselves (in this case better representative democracy) we can also expect them to save time for people trying to achieve those impacts through other means. </p>
    <p>Although Matthew Somerville sees no reason why TheyWorkForYou.com won’t survive another 10 years (“Parliament will certainly still be around”), it should be of some concern that Tom Steinberg describes the site as a “residual” from before mySociety changed its mission to focus on helping international NGOs develop similar websites through projects like Pombola. Somerville sees lots more work for mySociety to do with TheyWorkForYou.com, and says that even if the official website becomes easier to use, many of TheyWorkForYou.com’s most important functions—like vote analysis and email alerts—may never be provided by Parliament:</p>
    <p><blockquote>There are many things the site still doesn't cover, but it's not like we have had countless volunteers [clamouring] to add select committees, or what have you.</blockquote></p>
    <p>This observation further calls into question how realistic it is to anticipate sustained activity from civic hackers (or indeed David Cameron’s “whole army of effective armchair auditors”) in response to the release of government data as open data. In fact, that pool of volunteers may be more limited than first imagined. mySociety has done recent, funded, work on TheyWorkForYou, the 60,000 additional pages of vote analysis supported by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust. But the fact that the site does not serve its Scottish users as at July 2015 because no one has volunteered to update the tool so that it can scrape the Scottish Parliament’s new website should be of major concern.</p>

    <h3>For open data advocates</h3>
    <ul class="small"><li>The Deloitte study on the impact of TfL data on transport users, and its analysis that TfL are delivering transport users annual monetised time savings of between £15m and £58m, is one of the most quoted stories of open data impact in policy circles. The Deloitte methodology can be borrowed to discuss impact in other spheres too.</li></ul></ul>
    <h3>For open data developers</h3>
    <ul class="small"><li>Shiny new projects are fun and inspiring, but established sites like TheyWorkForYou.com need volunteer developers too. Open data developers should consider whether knowing you’re contributing work to a project that is having long-term positive impacts for representative democracy makes up for some of the hassle of working on someone else’s code.</li></ul></ul>
    <h3>For funders</h3>
    <li>Projects like TheyWorkForYou.com need long-term commitment, and may not be able to rely on volunteer efforts to keep going.</li></ul>

  summary: >
    <p>The Open Public Services Network undertook two major pieces of work exploring how government data, beyond traditional accountability mechanisms like league tables, can be used to evaluate schools. The resulting outputs—A GCSE Schools Guide produced in association with the <i>Guardian</i>, and a report into lack of access to “hard” subjects like triple science at GCSE in deprived areas—succeeded in reaching both parents and policymakers, and drew significant press attention. This study focuses on the contribution open data can make to improving public services.</p>
  takeaways: >
    <ul class="small"><li>OPSN told both a local and a national story with the data it had. The GCSE Schools Guide tool let users see what the data had to say about schools near them. The <i>Lack of Options</i> report took a broad, national perspective. </li></ul>
    <li>The long-term impact of OPSN’s work may best be viewed in the same light as OpenCorporates’ contribution to the campaign for beneficial ownership transparency: just one piece of a complex puzzle.</li>
    <li>Some of the data OPSN used in this case derived from the National Pupil Database, which is not open data. Much of the data needed to meaningfully evaluate public services will never be released—and indeed should never be released—as open data because it contains personal information about service users. It is in the public interest that an understanding of this data does not reside wholly within government. But vested interests and negative press attention driven by a vocal and effective privacy lobby in the UK serve to make this kind of data-sharing policy “a nasty political space”.</li>
    <li>Neither official government interpretations of public services data nor interpretations provided by the press fully meet the needs of public service users. But business models for organisations that could serve the public’s needs are thin.</li>
    <li>Prime Minister David Cameron predicted open data policy would trigger a volunteer “army of effective armchair auditors” who would interrogate government data in the public interest. In fact, that army has been slow to advance.</li></ul>

    <p>“We cannot continue to allow generation after generation of pupils to be let down simply because of the accident of where they were born.” – Chris Skidmore MP</p>
    <p>“All this information about hospitals or doctors or whatever: if it can’t be used to answer the question ‘should I have this treatment?’, ‘should I let this doctor operate on me?’ then all that does is simply allow the public to watch through the glass window and see how the professionals sort it out among themselves.” – Roger Taylor, OPSN</p>
  background: >
    <p>The Open Public Services Network (OPSN) uses data to encourage debate about the quality of public services in ways that engage and empower service users. Hosted at the Royal Society of the Arts, it is run by Charlotte Alldritt, a former government policy advisor, and chaired by Roger Taylor, once a <i>Financial Times</i> journalist who in 1999 co-founded Dr Foster, a ground-breaking information service that focussed on the performance of hospitals and that later attracted controversy when it was part-sold to the government.</p>
    <p>OPSN published its first major report—<i>Empowering Parents, Improving Accountability</i>, about the performance of schools in England—in September 2013. To time with its publication, the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper released a GCSE Schools Guide portal that allowed parents to search through OPSN’s data to discover which schools performed best on which subjects in England, and how accomplished schools were at improving individual pupils’ outcomes in exams. In 2015, OPSN followed up this work with a report highlighting subject deserts, Local Education Authorities (LEAs) in England where challenging subjects such as triple science and modern languages were sparsely offered or not offered at all.</p>
  data: >
    <p>For its first report, <i>Empowering Parents, Improving Accountability</i>, OPSN’s aim was to see what existing data sources published by the government could tell parents about schools. It drew on open datasets published by the Department for Education (DfE) on data.gov.uk, including exam performance data, and pupil and school characteristics data. </p>
    <p>The report also used inspection reports published by Ofsted, the government’s schools regulator. It called on Ofsted to release the data contained in these reports in an accessible format that enables analysis, noting that “at present it mainly exists by school in .pdf format”. </p>
    <p>For its second report, <i>Lack of options: how a pupil’s academic choices are affected by where they live</i><i> </i>OPSN used data from the DfE’s National Pupil Database. This dataset is not open data, and the pupil-level data it holds is deemed “personal” under the Data Protection Act. The DfE is authorised to share it at various levels of detail under strict terms and conditions with named bodies (including schools, local authorities, and other government departments). Third parties can apply to have access to the data—again, at various levels of detail—to conduct research or provide information services for the purpose of promoting the education or well-being of children. The DfE provides guidance on how analysis of the data may be reported in order to protect the privacy of the individual pupils on the database.</p>
    <p>OPSN accompanied both reports with data releases of its own, releasing the data that drove its analyses for others to re-purpose and re-use. The data is released in Microsoft Excel’s Open XML format (.xlsx), under a CC-BY licence. </p>
  path_to_impact: >
    <p>The aim of the project was to demonstrate that public service transparency, driven by open data can “support a richer and more multi-dimensional approach to accountability than is offered by the current exam results league tables and Ofsted report-based regime”. OPSN believes that data on schools and other public services represents “a multitude of truths” that are not captured by current accountability frameworks. In its report OPSN quotes research that shows that such frameworks have “relatively little influence on the choices people make”.“What good looks like varies against what you’re trying to measure,” says Charlotte Alldritt. Different service users want to ask different questions to evaluate public services according to their own contexts.</p>
    <p>For the 2013 report, OPSN convened a panel of experts representing qualifications authorities, school governors, pupils, teachers, and others. Together they devised a set of features they thought represented the way parents thought about the quality of education offered by schools: facilities; climate of learning; curriculum and pupil outcomes. OPSN then set about interpreting the data sources available to see how fit they were at addressing variations in these features. The data they came up with included new measures, such as rates of uptake of different subjects at GCSE. This data was republished by the<i> Guardian</i> on a postcode-driven searchable portal that allowed parents to compare local schools, the <i>Guardian</i> GCSE schools guide. </p>
    <p>It was during the research for <i>Empowering Parents, Improving Accountability </i>that Roger Taylor says he began to notice how many schools were not showing GCSE results for challenging subjects like the individual sciences (Physics, Biology, and Chemistry—commonly shortened to “triple science”) and modern languages. This observation led to the second of OPSN’s education research projects, using National Pupil Database data to ascertain which schools were not offering these subjects across England.</p>
    <p>The report identified six LEAs where 30% or more of schools had no pupils enrolled in triple science: Medway, Slough, Newcastle upon Tyne, City of Kingston Upon Hull, Knowsley, and North East Lincolnshire. In only 41 of England’s 151 LEAs did all schools have at least one pupil enrolled in triple science (see Figure 7). </p>

    <p><b>Figure 7: Access to triple sciences across English schools, taken from </b><i><b>Lack of Options </i></b><b>report. Copyright OPSN. Reproduced with permission.</b></p>
    <p>The report then shifted its focus to all science GCSEs (including dual-award science, which covers subjects in biology, physics, and chemistry and is worth two GCSEs). This uncovered one LEA where some pupils were taking no science subjects at all (Knowsley). Mapping this data against deprivation data (available as open data on data.gov.uk) showed—with notable exceptions—that there was some relationship (see Figure 8). The report concluded that “fewer science GCSEs per pupil tend to occur in poorer areas”. </p>

  outcome: >
    <p>The Cabinet Office, which profiled the <i>Guardian</i> GCSE Schools Guide as an open data case study a month after its launch, reports that the portal attracted 20,000 users on its first day of release. Given the number of pupils receiving GCSE results across England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland in 2015 was around 700,000, this is a significant proportion of the project’s target audience. The GCSE Schools Guide has also been picked up by the World Bank as an example of open data use cases in the education sector.</p>
    <p>The 2015 <i>Lack of Options</i> report received substantial press coverage when it was published in 2015. Its headline, that some LEAs in England were subject deserts, was reported extensively by the BBC and picked up by specialist education news outlets and local papers,, in the areas highlighted as performing poorly. The <i>Daily Mail</i><i> </i>also gave the story prominence, highlighting its critique of official league tables. </p>
    <p>Chris Skidmore MP, a former member of the Education Select Committee, tabled a bill in the House of Commons in response to the <i>Lack of Options </i>report that would guarantee pupils the opportunity to study triple science, and quoted the report’s findings extensively. In closing his speech, he stated:</p>
    <p><blockquote>Poverty of aspiration, which lowers horizons and dims lights that should be burning brightly, still reaches into areas of our education system, and into places where education is most needed to transform young lives. We cannot continue to allow generation after generation of pupils to be let down simply because of the accident of where they were born or what school they attend.</blockquote></p>
    <p>The OPSN succeeded in engaging its target audiences: the public, the media, and policymakers. This is impressive in itself. But beyond that, how can we understand its impact? Will OPSN’s intervention affect subject availability in deprived areas? </p>
    <p>Like much proposed legislation put forward by backbenchers, Chris Skidmore’s bill did not make it far through the UK’s legislative process. In any case, an expert convening in response to <i>Lack of Options</i> attended by the author in June 2015 concluded that the problems highlighted by the report were far more likely to be addressed by broader education reforms. In the end, the <i>Lack of Options </i>report may prove to be just one piece of evidence put forward on the long journey towards policy reform.</p>

  discussion: >
    <p>The success of OPSN’s interventions in the education space mirrors that of an American project undertaken by ProPublica in 2011. <i>The Opportunity Gap </i>app<i> </i>used US Department of Education data to show that where some states, like Florida, offer rich and poor students roughly equal access to high-level courses, other states, like Kansas, Maryland, and Oklahoma, offer less opportunity in deprived districts. In his analysis of this project, ProPublica’s Scott Klein writes:</p>
    <p><blockquote>We … worked really hard at making sure the app told a “far” story and a “near” story. That is, the app needed to present the reader with a broad, abstract national picture—specifically, a way to compare how states did relative to each other on educational access. But given that abstraction sometimes leaves readers confused as to what the data means to them, we also wanted readers to be able to find their own local school and compare it to high and low-poverty schools in their area.</blockquote></p>
    <p>OPSN’s work also tells two different stories. The appeal to the public (through the GCSE schools guide) and the appeal to the press and policymakers (through the <i>Lack of Options</i> report) are subtly different, and point to an understanding that drives OPSN’s work: Service users want to ask different questions of public service data than service providers. At the heart of this approach lies a challenge to models of thinking about public service improvement through open data.</p>
    <p>“People need simple heuristics to guide them in their lives and understand what is going on,” says Roger Taylor, Chair of the OPSN. He is deeply sceptical about the model of public service improvement through open data vaunted by David Cameron, who, when he announced new measures to publish local government spending in 2010, predicted the birth of “a whole army of effective armchair auditors looking over the books”. </p>
    <p>High-profile cases of public spending waste have been exposed thanks to open data, for example, when hundreds of millions of pounds in potential annual savings on prescriptions for statins were identified in 2012 (for more on the impact of this case, see <b>Error! Reference source not found.</b>). But since the government’s big push to publish more government data in order to improve public services in 2010, several commentators have noted that Cameron’s army are, for the large part, still yet to advance. </p>
    <p>In November 2012 the think tank Policy Exchange blamed the lack of armchair auditors on the fact that data like the Combined Online Information System of government spending (COINS) was “unusable” . And in April 2015 the Institute for Government pointed out that much of the data armchair auditors would need to hold the government to account was inaccessible, or of poor quality.</p>
    <p>But the data may only be half the problem. Roger Taylor says that while good data analysis doesn’t take a large corporation to do, it does need significant resources: </p>
    <p><blockquote>Analysing complex datasets and trying to get useful signal out of all the noise is expensive and time-consuming. It isn’t something you can do in your armchair …. It really does come down to small numbers of extremely talented and able people</blockquote><blockquote>.</blockquote></p>
    <p>Drawing on his experience with Dr Foster, he worries that business models to support such operations “are very thin”. Although he is clear that the Department of Health “never once attempted to use its influence to affect anything we said,” after it paid £12m for a 50% stake in the company in 2006, “basic economics” meant the organisation ended up focussing on how to meet the information needs of NHS organisations and healthcare professionals, not how to meet the information needs of the public and patients: </p>
    <p><blockquote>Professionals always err towards the more cautious side, with the result that what you tend to get from more professional organisations are really complex presentations of data, with massive amounts of caveats about over-interpretation. They tend to prefer presenting the raw data rather than [stating] what it means, with the result that it means nothing to the public and they really can’t act on it.</blockquote></p>
    <p>This situation disempowers service users: </p>
    <p><blockquote>All this information about hospitals or doctors or whatever: if it can’t be used to answer the question “should I have this treatment?”, “should I let this doctor operate on me?” —if it can only be used inside the system—then all that does is simply allow the public to watch through the glass window and see how the professionals sort it out among themselves.</blockquote></p>
    <p>Taylor adds that traditional media approaches to public service evaluation often mislead the public because “the way our media dialogue works is through over-simplification”. But he also believes that even when the media take a more data-literate approach, the media business model doesn’t support the sorts of personalised information services people need:</p>
    <p><blockquote>[To] get this information to the point where it works for an individual … and have a business model working you’ll probably need a pretty intimate connection with that individual …. An old fashioned publishing model, where you try and earn revenues from publishing ratings or advice sheets or that kind of stuff—it’s really hard to make that work.</blockquote><blockquote> </blockquote></p>
    <p>It’s important to note that the <i>Lack of Options </i>report was produced using non-open data: a version of the National Pupil Database for which researchers need the approval of the Department for Education in order to access. Taylor believes that, through the open data agenda, “we’ve set a standard for data release that is wholly inappropriate to most of the information that is of interest in terms of public services”:</p>
    <p><i>For anything to do with mental health, education, to make sense of what is going on you need to understand about the outcomes for people, what happened to them and data about their personal circumstances. There’s no way [you can] put that data together in usable formats and then simply put it out under an </i><i>Open Government Licence</i><i>.</i></p>
    <p>“It is in the public interest that an understanding of what [the data says] does not reside wholly within government,” says Taylor, but getting this data out of government and into the hands of approved third parties, for example on terms similar to those of the National Pupil Database, is hard. “It’s a nasty political space to try and move forward on,” says Taylor. He believes that vocal and effective privacy campaigners in the UK mean this type of government data sharing attracts negative press attention, while behind the scenes, vested interests such as professional bodies and government departments use their power to block progress. By contrast:</p>
    <p><blockquote>Open data is really straightforward. So you see why all the political focus has gone in that direction. But unfortunately, we aren’t actually going to get many useful outputs from that process.</blockquote></p>
  action: >
    <h3>For policymakers</h3>
    <ul class="small"><li>Policymakers should recognise the role personal data has to play in improving public services. It will never be appropriate to make such data generally available as open data, but neither is it appropriate for an understanding of what such data has to say about public services to reside wholly within government. Successive governments in the UK have damaged public trust on issues around the security and exploitation of sensitive personal data. If policymakers are serious about using data to improve public service, then strategies to regain that trust, as well as tackle those vested interests that fear third-party scrutiny of public service delivery, should be top of their agenda.</li></ul></ul>
    <h3>For open data advocates</h3>
    <li>Open data advocates should recognise that releasing personally identifiable, sensitive data as open data is not appropriate. </li>
    <li>Open data advocates should partner with privacy advocates to encourage policymakers to engage in this “nasty political space” in ways that are technically literate and respect privacy.</li></ul>
    <h3>For funders</h3>
    <ul class="small"><li>Funders need to be realistic about the capacity of volunteer “armchair auditors” to improve public services. Targeted support for skilled infomediaries should be part of the open data funding mix.</li></ul></ul>

  summary: >
    <p>2013 saw the UK Government concurrently host the Open Government Partnership (OGP) summit and hold the presidency of the G8. Prime Minister David Cameron used this joint platform to launch a positive commitment to beneficial ownership transparency (identifying the real owners of corporate entities—a key tool in eliminating the ability of anonymous shell companies to mask financial corruption) that has the potential to drive global norms on the issue. Behind the scenes, a coalition of civil society groups focussed on corruption, fraud, overseas development, and tax justice were driving the agenda, aided by open corporate data pioneer OpenCorporates.</p>
    <p>This case study shows how OpenCorporates was able to leverage its expertise in order to play a critical, if minor, role in the success of the campaign for beneficial ownership transparency. It also discusses two issues in open data impact as a driver for social change: the continuing role of traditional advocacy and the limits of so-called exhaust PSI.</p>
  takeaways: >
    <ul class="small"><li>Moving the needle on complex issues like corruption and governance reform requires much more than opening government data: The success of just this one chapter in the campaign for beneficial ownership transparency relied upon a concurrence of factors including political mood, external events, and focussed, concerted efforts from traditional advocacy organisations.</li></ul>
    <li>OpenCorporates’ expertise, gained from years of handling government data (open and not open) about companies, had a critical, if minor, role to play in this success. OpenCorporates could not have gained this success on its own.</li>
    <li>The role of the open data community should not just be to use the government data it is given, but to demand the government data it needs.</li></ul>

    <p>“If it was just OpenCorporates, of course it wouldn't have happened. But the example they were showing and the technical understanding that they had as a result of that, was really critical.” David McNair, Save The Children/ONE </p>
    <p>“[Political lobbying] is really hard. I mean, the stuff I do, the data, the coding stuff, that's way easier than that sort of stuff.” Chris Taggart, OpenCorporates</p>
  background: >
    <p>In 2010 the World Bank published a report showing that of 213 grand corruption investigations across 80 countries, 150 involved corporate vehicles that shielded the true beneficiaries of financial transactions. In these 150 cases, the total proceeds of corruption amounted to approximately $56.4 billion. The report, <i>The</i> <i>Puppet Masters: How the corrupt use legal structures to hide stolen assets and what to do about it</i>, opens with the example of a tender put out by the Kenyan government to replace its passport system:</p>
    <p><blockquote>Despite receiving a bid for €6 million from a French firm, the Kenyan government signed a contract for five times that amount (€31.89 million) with Anglo-Leasing and Finance Ltd, an unknown UK shell company, whose registered address was a post office box in Liverpool. The Kenyan government’s decision was taken despite the fact that Anglo-Leasing proposed to subcontract the actual work to the French company. Material leaked to the press by whistle-blowers suggested that corrupt senior politicians planned to pocket the excess funds from the deal. Attempts to investigate these allegations were frustrated, however, when it proved impossible to find out who really controlled Anglo-Leasing.</blockquote></p>
    <p>One of the report’s key recommendations was that information available at company registries should be improved and made more easily available. The recommendation echoed that made by a similar report published by the OECD in 2001, <i>Behind the Corporate Veil: Using Corporate Entities for Illicit Purposes, </i>which called on governments “to ensure they are able to obtain information on the beneficial ownership and control of corporate entities”. </p>
    <p>OpenCorporates is the largest open database of companies in the world. Founded by “open data veterans” Chris Taggart and Rob McKinnon, it launched at the end of 2010 covering 3.8 million UK past and present companies. As Chris Taggart told the Open Data Institute in 2012:</p>
    <p><blockquote>We take messy data from government websites, company registers, official filings and data released under the Freedom of Information Act, clean it up and using clever code make it available to people.</blockquote></p>
    <p>The launch of OpenCorporates predates the decision by Companies House to release all the data it holds as open data. But Companies House has made more basic datasets available for several years, and it was this data, combined with other government data sources (for example government spending data and Health and Safety notices) that fuelled OpenCorporates in the beginning. Taking the same mixed input approach, OpenCorporates has now expanded its coverage to over 105 jurisdictions and 85 million companies today.</p>

    <p>Chris Taggart, the CEO of OpenCorporates, was in touch with the NGOs working on beneficial ownership transparency, but he wasn’t on the weekly calls that led up to the G8. Thanks to a small grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, OpenCorporates had been delving into the corporate structure issue separately to Global Witness and the NGOs involved in the IF campaign. </p>
    <p>OpenCorporates was investigating a generalised approach to how complex corporate structures could be modelled and constructed using diverse official and regulatory data, and represented within the OpenCorporates dataset. The project kicked off with three separate datasets: shareholder data from New Zealand’s company registry, to which OpenCorporates already had access through an API key; and two datasets from US regulators. At the heart of the project was the idea that in the age of the internet, “you can have corporate structure set ups appear that can be as complex as the computers that can cope with them”, and that society could only combat the proliferation of complex corporate structures through better data. </p>
    <p>To make this case, OpenCorporates worked with data visualisation studio Kiln on a series of visualisations to underscore the complexity of the structures behind a handful of the world’s more recognisable global companies, mainly in the financial sector. One of the visualisations—representing Goldman Sachs—is shown in Figure 6. </p>

    <p>Displaying the country of incorporation in a map-based way required “some significantly difficult maths,” says Taggart. But it lends the message a visual power: The landmass shown below the United States in Figure 6 is the Cayman Islands, an offshore tax haven in which Goldman Sachs has 739 registered subsidiaries.  </p>
  path_to_impact: >
    <p>In 2012, Global Witness, a civil society group that investigates and exposes the links between natural resources, corruption, and conflict, began dedicating more resources to moving the needle on the beneficial ownership issue. Though their original advocacy target was EU Money-Laundering Regulations, which were about to be updated, Global Witness soon became aware that political forces in the UK were aligning to make the UK’s hosting of the G8 summit at Lough Erne a favourable venue for pushing reform. If they could get the G8 leaders to commit to beneficial ownership transparency, they could begin establishing a global norm.</p>
    <p>The UK government was under pressure to respond to several financial scandals, including angry press coverage of the tax avoidance in the UK of major US firms Amazon, Starbucks, and Google, and the 2012 US Senate investigations into British bank HSBC’s involvement in money-laundering for Mexican drug cartels. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2013, David Cameron called on the G8 to get its own house in order on corporate transparency, citing the “long and tragic history of some African countries being stripped of their minerals behind a veil of secrecy”, and outlining a three-pronged agenda for his presidency of the G8: Trade, Tax, and Transparency.</p>
    <p>Robert Palmer, head of Global Witness' banks and corruption campaign, calls the speech “a real moment in the campaign, where … the direction of travel of the UK agenda [became clear]”. In it, Cameron cites the work of the economist Paul Collier, Professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Oxford, and sources at the Cabinet Office confirm that Collier’s work had a big influence on the Prime Minister. Also influencing the Prime Minister according to these sources was the fact that G8 leaders “were unlikely to turn up to the meeting with their cheque books open”. A coup like the one accomplished by Tony Blair at the Gleneagles summit in 2005, where G8 leaders committed significant funds in aid to Africa, was unlikely. A “new way of thinking” was therefore needed.</p>
    <p>Also looking to repeat the successes of the UK’s last G8 presidency were a group of civil society organisations involved in the original Make Poverty History campaign that targeted Gleneagles. The Enough Food for Everyone IF campaign was a coalition of major development NGOs, including Save the Children, Oxfam, Christian Aid, and CAFOD. A subset of this group, chaired by David McNair (then at Save the Children and now at the ONE Campaign), and including Robert Palmer (though Global Witness were never formally part of the IF campaign), began holding weekly calls on the beneficial ownership issue in the lead-up to the G8. Robert Palmer remembers:</p>
    <p><blockquote>It was one of the most impressive group of campaigners I have ever been around …. The G8 campaign was a real collaborative effort between groups like Global Witness who could bring our policy knowledge … and groups like Christian Aid, and the ONE Campaign, who had political access and campaigners and supporters they could mobilise.</blockquote></p>
    <p>At Lough Erne in June 2013, the G8 leaders committed to a core set of principles “to prevent the misuse of companies and legal arrangements” that included measures on beneficial ownership, and David Cameron committed the UK to a central registry of company beneficial ownership information. He said he would consult on whether to make the registry public. Reporting on the results of the G8 summit to Parliament, Cameron stated that there were “strong arguments for public registers of beneficial ownership all over the world”. Ensuring that the registry was open to all became the new focus of the civil society campaign.</p>
  outcome: >
    <p>The OpenCorporates briefing was published after the G8 announcement, in July 2013. Robert Palmer remembers it well:</p>
    <p><blockquote>I think it was one of the things that was really powerful about what Chris could do. He had company data, he had the raw data that he could use to demonstrate the ridiculousness of some of these sorts of situations.</blockquote></p>
    <p>The visualisation was reported extensively but almost exclusively by the technology press. Yet although it may not have enjoyed mainstream impact in and of itself, the work OpenCorporates had put in behind the scenes had a key role to play in the period between the G8 announcement and the UK’s hosting of the OGP Summit in October 2013.</p>
    <p>Devising the generalised data structure for corporate relationships as part of the Sloan work was “one of the hardest things I’ve ever done in my life,” says Taggart. But a by-product of this sort of handling of open government data is the ability to speak the language of internal government bureaucracies. This turned out to be a key advocacy tool. The labour put into establishing, for example, how to represent the multiplicity of different structures, how to define what a subsidiary was in the face of different national interpretations, how to represent changes in a structure over time, paid off once OpenCorporates became more deeply involved in the campaign for a public beneficial ownership registry in the UK post-G8:</p>
    <p><blockquote>Going down to that sort of level is really important …. It's not just the fact that there should be a public beneficial ownership register, nor even that there should be a public beneficial ownership register that is open data. How is the data stored? What's being done on it? How is that being recorded? What level of granularity? What should we do here? What should we do there? Understanding the problem is a nontrivial part of the puzzle here.</blockquote></p>
    <p>David McNair agrees:</p>
    <p><blockquote>The added value that I saw OpenCorporates bring was that very, very detailed knowledge of how this database would work …. If it was just OpenCorporates of course it wouldn't have happened. But the example they were showing in terms of demonstrating that it's possible to build a database, and the technical understanding that they had as a result of that, was really critical for making the standard robust.</blockquote><blockquote> </blockquote></p>
    <p>Robert Palmer echoes this sentiment, calling what OpenCorporates did “data-based advocacy”. He recalls a moment when the Department for Business were consulting on whether directors’ and shareholders’ full dates of birth should be published on the register: OpenCorporates were able to demonstrate using real data that were dates of birth to be partially redacted, investigators would be unable to identify individual directors and shareholders robustly in cases numbering in the tens of thousands.</p>
    <p>Palmer also argues that OpenCorporates was instrumental in pushing NGOs to demand the registry be made publicly available:</p>
    <p><blockquote>One of the biggest impacts that OpenCorporates had on the campaign was to insist that the new beneficial ownership information be provided as open data and this was a key part of the eventual NGO position and the final government announcement.</blockquote></p>
  project: >
  impact: >
    <p>In October 2013, David Cameron announced at the OGP summit that the UK’s registry of beneficial owners would indeed be public. It was a major success for the campaign. </p>
    <p>Commitments to beneficial ownership transparency are now spreading as a global norm, just as Robert Palmer and his fellow campaigners had hoped. But the campaign is by no means won. Indeed, when the G20 announced its commitment to beneficial ownership transparency in November 2014, language around making national registries public was very much missing, to the disappointment of transparency NGOs.</p>
    <p>In the UK, Chris Taggart will be watching for the impact of the new rules:</p>
    <p><blockquote>What's going to be interesting is the number of companies that dissolve and remove themselves from the register before the beneficial ownership requirements come in.</blockquote></p>
  discussion: >
    <p>The expertise OpenCorporates has gained across years of handling government data about companies, and especially the work it did on complex corporate structures, played a critical, if minor, role in achieving the overall impact discussed in this study: the Prime Minister’s commitment to a public register of beneficial owners in the UK.</p>
    <p>The success of this chapter in the campaign for beneficial ownership transparency relied upon a rare concurrence of factors including political mood, external events, and focussed, concerted efforts from traditional advocacy organisations. The combination of the UK hosting the G8 as well as chairing the Open Government Partnership was also a lucky break. Open data expertise had some role to play in this success, but it could not have gained it in isolation. This last point is perhaps the point of this study: Moving the needle on complex issues like corruption and governance reform requires much more than opening government data. Chris Taggart says he has “so much respect for the other actors involved”, and the lobbying work they did:</p>
    <p><blockquote>That stuff's really hard. I mean, the stuff I do, the data, the coding stuff, that's way easier than that sort of stuff. </blockquote></p>
    <p>Could the G8/OGP summit campaign have succeeded without OpenCorporates? The G20 commitment contained no language on beneficial ownership registers being public, and it’s tempting to speculate that this could be because no equivalent organisation to OpenCorporates was involved in the campaign running up to the G20. However, it’s likely that individual and entrenched political cultures in the G20 group played a larger role: Insiders say China was the major block in making beneficial ownership registries public.</p>
    <p>The story of OpenCorporates’ role in the campaign for beneficial ownership transparency has been picked up by Jonathan Gray and Tim Davies in their arguments for participatory data infrastructures:</p>
    <p><blockquote>We think the case of campaigning for a public registry of beneficial ownership in the UK is an interesting example of where calling for the disclosure of existing datasets was not enough—as the information needed was not routinely collected by the public sector. Civil society organisations had to undertake a more creative, sustained and holistic engagement with shaping and influencing the development of data infrastructures as socio-technical systems.</blockquote></p>
    <p>Their argument, that most government open data is an administrative by-product and may not therefore capture aspects of its subject needed by data re-users such as advocates, is radical and relevant.</p>
    <p><blockquote>We contend that a politics of public information fit for the digital age should go beyond the question of what datasets are disclosed when and to whom, and should additionally ask what information should be collected and generated in the first place.</blockquote></p>
  action: >
    <h3>For open data advocates</h3>
    <ul class="small"><li>The next phase of open data advocacy involves influencing the data the government collects. The role of the open data community should not just be to use the government data it is given, but to demand the government data it needs.</li></ul>
    <li>Traditional advocacy organisations, with their political experience, strategic thinking and networks of influence, make powerful allies in campaigns to open up government data.</li></ul>
    <h3>For open data practitioners</h3>
    <li>A by-product of daily handling of open government data is the ability to speak the language of internal government bureaucracies. That ability can be a powerful tool in advocacy.</li></ul>
    <h3>For funders</h3>
    <ul class="small"><li>Traditional advocacy efforts can be complemented and enhanced by open data approaches. This might mean a new presentation of the facts based on open data sources, or simply the inclusion in civil society coalitions of open data practitioners able to speak the language of internal government bureaucracies thanks to their daily handling of government data.</li></ul></ul>

    <p>Founded by the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO), with support from Omidyar Network and others, Mejora Tu Escuela (<u><a href="http://mejoratuescuela.org)" rel="nofollow">http://mejoratuescuela.org)</a></u> is an online platform that provides citizens with information about school performance. It helps parents choose the best option for their children, empowers them to demand higher-quality education, and gives them tools to get involved in their children’s schooling. It also provides school administrators, policymakers and NGOs with data to identify areas requiring improvement and hotbeds of corruption, in the process raising the overall quality of education in Mexico. </p>
  takeaways: >
    <p>Key Takeaways:</p>
    <ul class="small"><li>Making previously inaccessible information available to the public is a major public service, but a necessary next step involves giving citizens a means to meaningfully act on that information.</li>
    <li>Platforms to reduce corruption run up against powerful vested interests. Open data advocates need to develop strategies not only to source and disseminate information, but also to push back against these interests. The challenges are as much social and political as they are technical.</li>
    <li>In cases where governments are reluctant to release potentially damaging information to the public, civil society can play an important role in finding creative ways to obtain, clean and publish that information.</li>
    <li>In countries with major societal problems like rampant corruption, it is easy to lose sight of the potentially impactful uses of open data to improve the everyday lives of citizens. </li></ul>
  background: >
    <p><b>Education in Mexico</b></p>
    <p>For years, education in Mexico has been substandard and generally lagged behind standards in other, comparable countries. This poor performance cannot be attributed to a lack of budgetary resources – Mexico spends a larger portion of its budget on education than any other member of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It is important to note, though, that, at least in part, this is due to the higher number of Mexican children who pass through the public school system than other OECD countries. But while that money has led to nearly universal basic education, outcomes remain stubbornly poor. Mexico’s graduation rates are near the bottom of OECD countries, with fewer than half of students earning a high school diploma. In addition, Mexican students perform poorly in international comparative tests of math, science and reading skills, and, according to a recent study, 80 percent of teachers failed an evaluation exam designed to test their competencies.</p>
    <p>While Mexico’s education system has been generously funded, it has suffered over the years from endemic corruption. The scale of corruption is difficult to calculate, but it is by all accounts massive. Last year, an “abuse meter” – a giant electronic signboard erected in the capital by activists that tries to update in real time the amount of waste – estimated that at least $2.8 billion are lost to corruption every year in the education sector. The year the billboard was erected, it showed more than $33 million lost in just the first week of the school year.</p>
    <p>The corruption takes many forms: ghost teachers on payrolls, preselling of exam results, officials with lavish lifestyles, teachers demanding bribes to give good grades and candidate teachers bribing to pass training tests. The rot is widespread and, increasingly, widely recognized. One activist recently referred to corruption in the education system as “the robbery of the century.” A 2009 report from Transparency International found that the average household paid an additional $30 per year for their children’s education, despite that education being “constitutionally free.” In 2010, Transparencia Mexicana’s National Index on Corruption and Governance found that parents paid a bribe 3.5 percent of the time when seeking an enrollment form for a public school.</p>
    <p><b>Information and Open Data in Mexico</b></p>
    <p>In Mexico, as in much of the world, information has increasingly been seen as a tool to combat corruption. As Gavin Starks argues in <i>The Guardian</i>: “Allowing citizens to freely access data related to the institutions that govern them is essential to a well-functioning democratic society. It is the first step toward holding leaders to account for failures and wrongdoing.” </p>
    <p>Mexico has tried to apply these principles to its education sector. In 2008, the Mexican Congress passed a law requiring all states to provide the federal government with information about the condition of schools, payrolls and other expenditures. At the time, this push for greater transparency was seen as a vital component of the effort to combat corruption in education. However, the law has proven largely toothless: Four out of 32 states did not hand over payroll databases for the last trimester of 2013, and eight states handed over empty or incomplete databases.</p>
    <p>It is in this context that Mexico’s open data initiatives must be considered – both as part of a strategy to combat corruption in education, and also to fight corruption in general. Currently, the country is ranked 24th in the Open Data Barometer, having moved up one spot since 2013. The government maintains a federal open data portal, which contains information from federal, state and municipal governments, as autonomous government entities (which are not subject to administrative and technical control from the central government), like the Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones. The open data portal is part of a broader National Digital Strategy championed by Ania Calderón, the director general of open data for the Mexican government, who is pushing to transition the way open data is treated from “a passive resource to actionable intelligence that can give us concrete results.”</p>
    <p>The<b> </b>portal has achieved some early wins, such as the release of 100 government data sets in 42 days soon after its launch. However, while such accomplishments are laudable, and may even have made some inroads, corruption remains a formidable challenge, and it is important to recognize the limitations of Mexico’s open data efforts thus far. Oscar Montiel, director of community engagement at Codeando México, an organization that seeks to “bring together the best talent and organizations to create a new generation of civic technology,” notes that while “on a policy level everything sounds fantastic,” the government’s open data plans are at times poorly executed. He also points out that while there does exist a federal open data portal, questions remain (as they do in all countries) over “who decides what should be open and when.” Finally, he adds that because Mexico’s open data ecosystem is largely built around (often multi-year) contracts and licenses, changes can take months or even years, and there is a general lack of agility when it comes to releasing open government data. </p>
    <p>Others are more positive. Rafael García Aceves of Transparencia Mexicana describes a “really vibrant community” of open data users in the country. He argues that it is up to the open data community “to identify and demand which data is needed and to work more on the analytical models,” and to come up with new “solutions” that can help “link data with problems.” In other words, as the government continues to make data available, the task facing Mexican open data community, both inside and outside government, is to find new, innovative ways of using that data, and to connect the data to real-world problems. </p>
  project: >
    <p>It is within this context of formidable challenges and limited successes – as well as a deeply entrenched and widely prevalent culture of corruption – that the success, however provisional, of Mejora Tu Escuela must be considered. Launched in 2013, Mejora Tu Escuela (“Improve Your School,” in Spanish) is a public, independent, nonprofit initiative with a team comprising members of the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO) and with support from Omidyar Network. The stated goal of the platform is to “promote citizen participation to improve education in Mexico.” The project is premised on the belief that “education in [Mexico] will improve only with the active commitment of all members of the educational community, including parents.”</p>
    <p>In an interview, Alexandra Zapata Hojel, the coordinator of educational projects at IMCO, explained that “Mejora Tu Escuela was born as an effort to really get parents involved in their child’s education.” At IMCO, there was a growing frustration that parent’s lack of ability to engage with the education system in Mexico created an enabling environment for special interests to influence the delivery of education. The parental disengagement is evident in what Zapata Hojel calls “a singular dissonance” in Mexican education: While the country performs quite poorly on various global measurements of education quality, citizen satisfaction in fact remains quite high. A survey conducted in 2013, for example, found that 78 percent of Mexican parents were satisfied or very satisfied with their children’s education (meanwhile, the country scored last in Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) tests among OECD countries). Unlike other examples in this series of case studies, therefore, the effort to use open data to improve Mexican education did not originate in or draw strength from public discontent – in fact, it began as an attempt to address public complacency.</p>
    <p>For Zapata Hojel, parental complacency is indicative of a wider problem: a lack of information. Historically, citizens have found it difficult to access or comprehend data that would point to the poor state of Mexican education. In addition, Mexico faces some challenges specific to a rapidly developing nation where levels of educational attainment and social mobility have increased dramatically across recent generations. As Zapata Hojel explained: “[For many] families where the parents graduated from 6th grade, if they see their children in middle school they automatically think that things are better than when they were growing up. So the first challenge we had to face was to kind of shake up the system and share with all of these parents the fact that education in Mexico was of an extremely poor quality and that we were on the bottom of the totem pole in terms of results on a worldwide scale. To do that, we had to access information on all of the schools in the country.”</p>
    <p><b>Project Description</b></p>
    <p>Currently, the Mejora Tu Escuela project comprises two key parts. The first is the public-facing platform, targeted at parents and other citizens with a role in the education community. The second is focused on the public-policy side and includes reports on problems with transparency, corruption, teacher payrolls and the like. This aspect of the project also enables media to uncover problems – especially problems related to corruption – in the education sector. Although both aspects of the project are important (and in many ways mutually reinforcing) the case study here is primarily concerned with the public-facing side.  </p>
    <p>The platform side of Mejora Tu Escuela has four components:</p>
    <ul class="small"><li>Get to Know Your School – the central information provision aspect of the project focuses on giving parents and other stakeholders access to a diversity of information on schools.</li></ul>
    <li>Compare Your School – allows parents to compare their child’s school to others in the same area, complete with an assigned school grade. The hope is that this piece of the platform will “get competition going between public schools.”</li>
    <li>Grade Your School – asks parents and other members of the school community to rate different aspects of a school on a scale of one-to-ten, and leave comments. This information is then fed into the Get to Know Your School stream of information. </li>
    <li>Improve Your School – in its current form, Improve Your School provides “concrete tools and suggestions to parents on how to participate in addressing problems in their child’s school.” In the future, this section will also be able to suggest concrete actions to parents or teachers based on the hyper-local needs identified (through crowdsourced reporting and/or existing data) for a given school.</li></ul>
    <p><img src="static/img/studies/mexico-0.png" /><blockquote>Figure 1: Mejora Tu Escuela</blockquote></p>
    <p><b>Get to Know Your School and Compare Your School</b></p>
    <p>Currently, Mejora Tu Escuela is populated by around 25 databases, with new databases being added as they are made available by the Ministry of Education. Pablo Clark, a content developer at IMCO, notes that likely the most important database is the 2013 census, which includes information about school infrastructure, the number of students in schools, the number of teachers, the names of principals, school locations and contact details (including phone number and email address, if they have one). Additional information is drawn from standardized test results, teacher assessments and other data focused on the educational proficiency of schools.</p>
    <p><b>School Grades</b></p>
    <p>In addition to providing – often previously inaccessible – data to parents on Mexican schools, Mejora Tu Escuela, as part of the Compare Your School stream, provides graded assessments of schools to enable parents to make better decisions about their children’s schooling and to push back against underachieving schools. </p>
    <p>Grades for schools are calculated through student result data, with a focus on results in mathematics and Spanish. Schools are then ranked according to four levels of education quality:<b> </b>“Excellent,” “Good,” “Panzazo” – an expression that roughly translates to “getting through by the skin of one’s teeth” – and “Failed.” While representing broad and perhaps somewhat crude measurements of school quality, these grades do allow parents to make informed decisions about school selection – and, equally important, empower citizens to demand results from school officials.</p>
  impact: >
    <p>The impact of Mejora Tu Escuela is evident in the amount of traffic the site receives – between 40,000-45,000 unique visits a day. As Zapata Hojel notes, these numbers are all-the-more remarkable given that IMCO has not invested heavily on dedicated marketing efforts at this point, instead relying on community engagement and word-of-mouth.</p>
    <p>Who are these visitors and the site’s users? As with the other case studies in this series, Mejora Tu Escuela’s impact has been diverse and diffuse, and can be measured by considering various demographic groups and dimensions of impact. We consider impact by taking into account two key beneficiaries (parents and officials) and discussing the site’s overall effect on two dimensions of impact (accountability and corruption).</p>
    <p><b>Impact on Beneficiaries</b></p>
    <p><b>Parents </b>have been the chief beneficiaries of the site.<b> </b>Prior to the site’s launch, it was virtually impossible for parents to access information about their children’s school. Zapata Hojel notes that this inaccessibility extended not just to test results or information about school facilities; even basic information like school addresses and phone numbers was difficult to access.</p>
    <p>The lack of information led to a feeling of disempowerment and disengagement on the part of parents. When launching the site, IMCO heard many stories about parents feeling intimidated by teachers, unwilling or unable to challenge them and demand accountability. Teachers were regarded as “untouchable people that can never be fired, that have so much power, and that can take your son or daughter out of school if they don’t like you.” </p>
    <p>Slowly, but undeniably, the information available on the site is changing the balance of power. IMCO has collected a number of anecdotes demonstrating the impact on parents. They include the story of a woman who was able to combat teacher absenteeism at her child’s school using the platform. Teacher absenteeism is a common problem in the Mexican education system, but teachers are rarely fired despite a law that dictates that teachers must be dismissed after three consecutive days of unjustified absences. In this case, the mother was able to use information from Mejora Tu Escuela, and sue the state for failing to fire the teachers in question. Now with the help of IMCO her story is being shared with other parent-teacher groups across the country.</p>
    <p>While parents have been the major beneficiaries of the site, the project’s sponsors have been surprised by the unintended impact on <b>policymakers and school officials</b>. For example, IMCO members and others involved with the site report that they get as many phone calls and emails from principals and local government officials as they do from parents: “We get governors, and people working for the governor’s office that call us up and say, ‘We’re using your data because your data is more reliable than that of the Ministry of Education.’” Clark notes that the number of emails and phone calls IMCO receives from teachers and school principals show “they needed this data. It shows that they have a great interest in having an active participation in their school.” In this way, Mejora Tu Escuela is not only empowering parents, but also gradually changing the attitude of government officials toward education and schools. </p>
    <p><b>Increased Accountability</b></p>
    <p>The impact of Mejora Tu Escuela can also be measured by considering its important role in increasing accountability. This is partly a result of greater parent involvement and empowerment; today, parents are demanding more from schools and school officials. The media, too, has played a role: Using information from the site, journalists have been able to unearth corruption and shine a spotlight on abuse.</p>
    <p>Government administrators and school officials have also played an important role in enforcing accountability. Like teachers, well-intentioned administrators who have long struggled to reform the education system have themselves been empowered by the site; they, too, have been using information to better monitor schools, teachers and the education system in general. IMCO staff note, for example, that it is only through the site that certain school officials find out they have been enrolled in certain federally funded programs. One official reportedly said: “I’ve never seen a cent of this money.” Through the information available on the site, school officials are able to identify corruption in the system, tracking down missing funds and pinpointing the places in the bureaucracy where money is being stolen.</p>
    <p>Despite such anecdotal evidence, the broader impact on accountability in Mexican education remains to be seen, however. García Aceves of Transparencia Mexicana notes that transparency does not always translate automatically to impact. “Mexico is just starting to realize that this link between transparency and accountability is not something that is linear or direct,” he says. “If you have more transparency, that doesn't mean that you have more accountability. It could actually be the opposite.” Felipe Estefan of Omidyar Network agrees while arguing that, although the link between transparency accountability is not always direct, transparency is a “necessary ingredient for increased accountability,” the ultimate goal of Mejora Tu Escuela.</p>
    <p><b>Corruption Report</b></p>
    <p>Finally, the website’s impact is evident in the way it has highlighted corruption within the education system and pushed the topic to the forefront of public discussion. In 2014, IMCO used Ministry of Education data available on the site to publish a report on the state of corruption in Mexico’s education system. The report’s findings were backed by the National Audit Agency and stirred national outrage.</p>
    <p>Among the report’s findings:</p>
    <ul class="small"><li>1,442 teachers on government payroll were between the ages of 100 and 105. Of these, 1,441 were registered in the state of Hidalgo, and all but one was born on December 12, 1912 (i.e., 12/12/12).</li></ul></ul>
    <li>70 teachers earned more than President Enrique Peña Nieto (who made around $15,000 per month). Of these, 19 worked at schools that had failed or barely passed the national standardized test.</li></ul>
    <li>The report also found that the average monthly national salary for Mexican teachers was $1,954, and that the teacher with the highest salary lived in Oaxaca state and earned $46,849 a month. In the state of Guerrero, there was a school with a single student, but six employees whose payroll added up to $6,644 per month.</li></ul>
    <li>The report uncovered 536 telesecundarias, or secondary and high school programs available in rural areas via satellite, that apparently operated without electricity. The report also showed that there existed a large number of “phantom schools” that were unregistered (and thus possibly nonexistent), yet that had several teachers on payroll.</li></ul>
    <p>Prior to the report’s public release, 10 states initiated audits, and teacher payrolls are now being funded by the federal government instead of state governments. Zapata Hojel hopes to see more “very clear policy results.” She adds: “We remain optimistic that things will slowly start to change. Our hope is that more monitoring of these information sources will begin to change how money is spent in this sector in Mexico.”</p>

  challenges: >
    <p>In seeking to change Mexican education, Mejora Tu Escuela is working against powerful forces and vested interests. Inevitably, it has faced, and continues to face, a series of challenges to its operations and growth plans. As we have seen so often in this series of case studies, open data programs and activists frequently encounter these types of challenges – they are part of the process of social change, and of changing the way information is consumed and disseminated. </p>
    <p><b>Standardized Test Cancellation</b></p>
    <p>Revelations of corruption can have unintended effects, especially when they come up against such vested interests. In 2014, IMCO’s corruption report uncovered the fact that 19 of the 70 teachers who make more than the Mexican president work at schools that “failed or barely passed the national standardized test.” That year, under pressure from the teachers’ union and others embarrassed by the results, as well as public pressure led by NGOs like Mexicanos Primero, the national standardized testing program was canceled. “As soon as we put standardized test results on the website, and as soon as parents were able to, for the first time ever, compare results amongst schools at the national level including private and public schools, four months later the federal government announced that the standardized tests were being cancelled,” laments Zapata Hojel.</p>
    <p>The cancellation of the tests led to a major gap in usable data to assess the effectiveness of teachers and schools. Thankfully, the testing has recently been reimplemented (albeit in a new form), and once the data is made public, IMCO will once again import the new data into Mejora Tu Escuela. Still, the cancellation has caused lasting difficulties. In addition to the challenge of a yearlong gap in data, IMCO will have to “find some way to make [the new results] comparable with the results from the last test, which had a different system.”</p>
    <p><b>Data Accessibility </b></p>
    <p>While national census data in many ways forms the backbone of Mejora Tu Escuela, it took considerable effort to gain access to that data. For example, only 16 percent of the nonpersonally identifiable information from the census was originally released. The government’s initial reluctance to release more information was, in part, due to apprehensions about the extent of corruption that would be revealed. Ultimately, much of the remaining data was leaked to IMCO (and other Mexican NGOs), and this data was posted online.</p>
    <p>Zapata Hojel notes that much of the data on the website cannot, therefore, be properly called “open data.” The information is, rather, a combination of open data, leaked data and information gleaned through scraping and citizen input. This holds potentially valuable lessons: Sometimes data activists must be creative in the ways they source information, combining a variety of inputs to create a genuinely useful tool.</p>
    <p><b>Data Quality</b></p>
    <p>In addition to problems with accessibility, IMCO has also faced considerable problems with data quality. Oscar Montiel of Codeando México, believes that the problem stems in part from the </p>
    <p>lower levels of quality required by government itself to do its job. He says: “Their standards are so low, even for themselves, for their own work that when you try to push a bit higher then they don't respond that well.”</p>
    <p>Whatever the source of the problem, IMCO has from the onset been faced with making accessible error-ridden and outdated data, often stored in inconsistent formats. The IMCO experience points to the significant difference between data being public and data being truly open – i.e., available in standardized, machine-readable technical formats. In many ways, in fact, IMCO has played a major role in cleaning the data, for example through citizen inputs that have corrected errors and updated information. Zapata Hojel notes that, going forward, much of the success of Mejora Tu Escuela will rely on whether or not IMCO and others will be able to push the government “to keep the platform up to date, to keep the platform current, to be able to provide parents and school communities with information that is valuable.” </p>
  looking_forward: >
    <p>Mejora Tu Escuela’s early years have provided valuable proof of concept, and its organizers are pushing ahead with new features and steps to grow the service. The coming months and years will witness a number of enhancements. Some of the additions or steps under consideration are described here. </p>
    <p><b>Connecting Needs with Actions</b></p>
    <p>Under its “Improve Your School” initiative, Mejora Tu Escuela is working to create concrete opportunities that would allow parents (and others) to take actions to address problems they identify. For example, one of the most common forms of cheating in Mexico involves teachers simply dictating answers to their students. Parents who identify this problem now have no way to solve it. Mejora Tu Escuela is looking to include a mechanism that would suggest to such parents that they donate one day per year of their own time to supervise a test. In this way, the gap between information and action can be narrowed.</p>
    <p><b>Publishing a School Budget</b></p>
    <p>Although the site includes a decent amount of information, it still does not clearly link school performance and infrastructure to budgets. This means, for example, that the federal government has no real idea how much it costs to educate a child across the country in various regions and localities. Zapata Hojel states that, in the future, Mejora Tu Escuela will work to add more specific and granular expenditure information – which will be a challenge considering that three levels of government are involved in public school budgeting – so that parents can not only see how schools are performing, but how they are performing relative to funds received. This, Zapata Hojel believes, will take the notion of accountability to a whole new level.</p>
    <p><b>Developing a Report Pipeline</b></p>
    <p>As it stands, when a parent has a problem related to their child’s school, the pathway to addressing that problem is intimidatingly opaque since different types of problems require different routes toward addressing them. “If it’s a problem related to bullying, it’s one route they need to take, and if the problem is in school infrastructure or sexual abuse, the trail they have to take is completely different.” Zapata Hojel believes that the pathways are intentionally obscured by the Ministry of Education, leading to not only parents, but also principals being unable to determine a school’s supervisor, for example.</p>
    <p>Upon gaining access to databases containing information on who key decision-makers are for different schools, IMCO is developing a new “Report Pipeline” to enable parents to report problems and gain step-by-step instructions for how to get that information to the relevant person. Zapata Hojel sees this as a way to “put pressure on some of these government systems and also … really be able to give parents help in resolving this.”</p>
    <p><b>Translating Information into Action</b></p>
    <p>For the<b> </b>people and organizations<b> </b>behind<b> </b>Mejora Tu Escuela, the larger ambition is not simply to provide an information portal, but to create a platform for action. García Aceves notes that, as it stands, “people may be more informed but probably they do not have the tools for activating the institutional mechanisms that they need to solve a problem.” While Mejora Tu Escuela provides tools that could be valuable for certain users, García-Aceves argues that every organization (including his own) should work toward developing tools with a clear eye toward impact. Estefan of Omidyar Network states that for Mejora Tu Escuela to achieve the greatest impact possible in the future, it should find ways to draw pathways between complaints (and complainers) and policy responses (and policymakers). Considering the difficulty of simply identifying relevant institutional decision-makers in the education system, Zapata Hojel and the team at IMCO will likely face significant challenges in finding ways to incentivize those decision-makers to actually respond to and address citizen complaints.</p>

  summary: >
    <p>Sweden has a long tradition of openness, democracy and public access to information. In 2010, a reform agenda for Swedish development cooperation (“Openaid”) was launched by the government to bring increased transparency to donor funding through opportunities created by technological advances. Part of this reform agenda included an Aid Transparency Guarantee that required public actors to make available all documentation and public information related to international development cooperation. This spurred the development of the <i>openaid.se</i> site by the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) in April 2011. The data hub, built on open government data, visualizes <i>when, </i>to <i>whom </i>and <i>why </i>aid funding was paid out and <i>what </i>the results were. The reforms are seen to be an important force for enhanced transparency and accountability in development cooperation at an international level and increased cooperation and involvement of more actors in Swedish development policy.</p>
  takeaways: >
    <p>Key Takeaways:</p>
    <p><ul class="small">
    <li>Open data can be used to increase the transparency and accountability of distinct groups simultaneously. While traditionally viewed as a means for holding government to account, <i>openaid.se</i> demonstrates the capability of holding, for example, both donors and recipients accountable for aid expenditures. The <i>openaid.se</i> platform also illustrates how the Swedish principle of open access to information can be updated in the age of digitization.</li>
    <li>International standards – such as the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) – can help governments and other bodies releasing data do so in a manner that enables the highest levels of comparability and broad use. Metadata – in this case, project documentation and geocoding – can further improve the usefulness of standardized data sets. </li>
    <li>A lack of clearly defined, high-level political commitments to publishing open data and enabling reuse can create major, but not insurmountable challenges. While Sweden now boasts such high-level commitments, throughout much of <i>openaid.se</i>’s development, no such policy existed.</li>
    </ul></p>
  background: >
    <p>Transparency and access to public information has a long-standing tradition in Sweden. The government was the first country in the world to enact a bill enforcing the principle of public access to information (“offentlighetsprincipen”) in 1776. This made it a requirement for all authorities to publish documents unless ad hoc legislation restricted their access. An unimpeded view by the public and media into governmental activities is still prioritized today in Bill 2009/10:175 on <i>Public Administration for Democracy, Participation and Growth</i>. Underlying this legislation is the belief that more accessible information provides a better basis for decisions and limits the scope for corruption and misuse of resources. Sweden’s commitment to openness and public scrutiny often places it near the top of transparency rankings. </p>
    <p>As part of its commitment to public access, Sweden launched an Aid Transparency Guarantee in 2010. Pursuant to the guarantee, all public actors that are allocated funds under international development cooperation are required to publish related information and documentation in an open format online. This includes an explanation of when, to whom and why money was made available, and what results have been achieved. In theory, such information enables relevant stakeholders to follow the whole chain of aid from overall decisions to implementation and monitoring. </p>
    <p>The manifestation of the Transparency Guarantee is the Openaid website (www.openaid.se) jointly launched in April 2011 by the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). The <i>openaid.se</i> data hub has several policy objectives: to promote active transparency, provide a better knowledge base for planning, steering and making decisions about Swedish aid allocations and aid policy priorities, increase participation in Swedish development cooperation, strengthen the preconditions for true accountability, restrict the space for corruption, duplication and inefficient use of resources and promote innovative thinking across different sectors related to development. </p>
    <p>The reform of aid development cooperation was inspired in part by commitments that had been made in the international fora, including IATI and the Paris Declaration, Accra Agenda for Action. The platform was also a core component of Sweden’s Open Government Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan, signed in September 2011. The Action Plan was focused on enabling the government to stay on track with planned proposals, as well as increasing the amount of input from civil society and committing to publish standardized data in the IATI format. Sweden’s commitment to reform in this sector also led the government to sign the Busan Partnership Agreement for Effective Development Cooperation, which sets time-bound commitments to fully publish aid information to a common, open standard. It also offers a framework for “continued dialogue and efforts to enhance the effectiveness of development cooperation” through information access on aid flows and activities in both donor and partner countries. </p>
  project: >
    <p>First launched in April 2011, <i>openaid.se</i> is a Web-based information service about Swedish aid built on open government data. The site enables the public, aid actors and other stakeholders to follow when, to whom and for what purposes aid funds have been disbursed, and with what results. The interface of the platform is extremely simple and intuitive, enabling anyone to use it. </p>
    <p>The website is built using public data at the activity level of individual aid contributions from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and other authorities and ministries that handle aid funds. The data is visualized as treemaps and graphs showing how and where aid is distributed by recipient type. Depending on the choice of filter, users also have the option of viewing a list of all activities, ranging from one to several thousand for each recipient. These activities can then be downloaded in an Excel compatible comma separated values (CSV) file and used to develop new applications. </p>
    <p>Other functionalities include visibility of the entire aid chain and activity structure displaying the link between, for example, a policy decision and a disbursement. A contact form is also available on the site in Swedish and English, allowing for citizens to directly share feedback and concerns with Sida. There is also an interface for mobile devices with customized interaction and design and a mobile app. One of the key features for this mobile app is a whistle-blower function, enabling users to report suspicions of fraud directly. </p>
    <h3>Underlying Data </h3>
    <p>The data available on the website is published according to the IATI standard on a monthly basis, making it easier to analyze and compare data sets from various sources. This commitment to a common standard of data is part of Sweden’s move toward implementing the Busan Outcome Document, which aims to have the full range of information publicly available in one open aid standard. </p>
    <p><img src="static/img/studies/sweden-0.png" /></p>
    <h4>Figure 1: Sweden’s Openaid.se</h4>
    <p>Over 80 percent of the data is currently available in a machine-readable format, with fully automated data collection each night. This includes all data provided by the 16 CSOs that have framework agreements with Sida. The first version of the site published over 100,000 documents at the activity level that could be sorted by disbursing agency or implementing partner. Since the launch, there have been over 15 additional updates, and the government has constantly sought to improve the quality of the data – including a focus on publishing results and evaluations data. There has also been a focus on adding new types of data in a form that can be aggregated. By the end of 2015, Sweden aimed to have 95 percent data compatibility with the IATI standard. There is also an ongoing integration between the CSO database and <i>openaid.se</i> that will eventually enable the government to show more detailed data and results for CSO activities funded by Sida.  </p>
    <h3>Open Format </h3>
    <p>Openaid.se is built as an open source WordPress site enabling other aid donors and recipients to make their own aid tracker installations using their own data and themes. This has huge potential value in terms of spreading transparency across the aid ecosystem as a whole. Sida has also enhanced the use of the openaid.se open format (API) so that consumers are able to reuse the data for third-party online API collections. Because of Sweden’s public access principles, this data belongs to the public domain by default. However, some restrictions are applied to sensitive or classified materials that are filtered out or materials where copyright is owned by someone else. In the case of the latter, the data is still available on <i>openaid.se</i>;<i> </i>however, it may not be republished without permission from the original copyright holder. </p>
  impact: >
    <p>Transparency is crucial to drive improvements in the way development cooperation is delivered internationally, especially for generous aid donors like Sweden who allocate 1 percent of their estimated gross national income (GNI) toward development assistance. In terms of impact, Sweden is playing a leading role among major donors through its innovative <i>openaid.se </i>platform which has received wide acclaim for publishing information that goes well beyond traditional reporting to include project documentation, geocoding and aid results data. These efforts have borne fruit – Sweden is one of the highest-ranked countries in the Transparency International’s 2014 Corruption Perception Index and is one of the highest-ranked donors in the Publish What You Fund 2014 Aid Transparency Index. Impact can be gauged according to increased donor transparency and accountability with follow-on effects to data quality as well as funding and management efficiencies: </p>
    <p><b>Increased Transparency and Accountability </b></p>
    <p>By opening access to the chain of aid delivery and expenditures, citizens and other key stakeholders have been able to hold the Swedish government to account and aid processes have become more efficient through improved service delivery, reduced opportunities for diversion and therefore corruption. The increased transparency has also enabled donor recipients to plan and manage the resources coming into their country more effectively in settings where multiple actors are active, thereby decreasing the incentive to provide inferior services. As such, the <i>openaid.se</i> platform has received strong political and management support and organization involvement at all levels.</p>
    <p>By opening aid data to public scrutiny, the demand on the government to improve and maintain high-quality data has also increased. According to Carl Elmstam, the transparency manager at Sida, “The process of implementing transparency and the IATI standard drives quality as it has forced us to take a hard look at our own data and learn from it.” According to Hanna Hellquist, former State Secretary for International Development, opening the data also enabled the government to fully understand the underlying problems and challenges that were built into Swedish aid reporting and IT systems. This understanding, coupled with external pressure, has forced Sida to constantly improve reporting processes and ameliorate any data flaws. </p>
    <p>This sort of transparency has the potential to radically decrease the incentive structure for corruption by enabling external stakeholders to pinpoint problems and support their demands for reform. It has also enabled aid to be targeted more specifically and in some cases, it has led to funds being earmarked for improving recipient-country governance, including projects that combat corruption.</p>
    <p>This would not have been possible without active engagement and strategic communication both internally with employees and externally with the public and recipient countries. Internally, the MFA and Sida started to design the site before any formal decisions had been made. To push the decision through, they held regular meetings with different actors within the government to address objections and link the initiative to broader commitments made in other parts of government, such as the PSI Directive, which calls for public authorities to release their data for reuse at no charge. In doing so, staffs were reminded of the importance of good and reliable data, not only for the organization but also for global development cooperation and partner countries. Externally, Sida worked to increase general awareness of the values of transparency, open data and data quality through communication and facilitation of reporting and data conversion for the CSOs they support. According to Hellquist, the opening of data has facilitated a cultural and attitude shift in the aid administration (MFA and Sida) regarding its relation to the public.</p>
    <h3>Improved Management Efficiency</h3>
    <p>The <i>openaid.se </i>platform has also shown substantial impact in terms of having more efficient reporting mechanisms, including improved information management systems and reduced costs for duplicate manual reporting of aid information, particularly at the country office level. These improved reporting mechanisms, in part spurred by the commitment to make their data available in the IATI standard, have enabled the government to save around US$7 million annually. It has also had follow-on benefits in terms of aid effectiveness, as the government has been able to analyze and compare data sets from partner country budget classifications, enabling stakeholders to see where aid is supporting their own priorities and increasing accountability. According to conservative estimates from IATI, approximately US$18 billion in aid is lost annually through corruption. Cost-benefit analyses show that greater aid transparency has the potential to reduce such corruption and improve predictability by US$1.6 billion annually. </p>
    <h3>Enabling Collaboration with Beneficiaries</h3>
    <p>Making aid information open is just the start. For transparency to be transformational, beneficiaries must actually use the aid data. One impact of the newly freed data on the <i>openaid.se</i> platform has been the ability of Sida to tap into the knowledge and creativity of a wide variety of stakeholders in Swedish society to come up with new ideas for tools, activities and functionalities for the site. </p>
    <p>It has also facilitated substantial and complex forms of collaboration with CSOs including PWYF, in pursuit of increased aid transparency. This has shifted the power dynamics between NGOs and the government, bringing the practice of the organization nearer to its principles of participation, accountability and empowerment. In this respect, Sida’s efforts have also served to improve other donors’ and partner countries’ development efforts by acting as a model for countries like Denmark, which recently launched a similar platform – Danida Open Aid. While it is difficult to assess whether the idea was explicitly emulated, the fact that <i>openaid.se</i> uses an open source Wordpress site removes the need for other countries to start from scratch when building their own initiatives. </p>
  challenges: >
    <p>Sweden has made huge strides toward more open, inclusive, accountable and responsive development through the <i>openaid.se </i>site, driving both political debate and opinion about aid priorities. Development coordination and spending between donors and partner countries have also improved, enabling greater impact with finite resources. Nonetheless, the government still faces numerous challenges in making the data easily comprehensible with the right tools to facilitate understanding, analysis and use by general audiences. If Sweden is to continue along the path to aid transparency on which it has set itself, several areas should be addressed: </p>
    <h3>Structural Challenges</h3>
    <p><i>Openaid.se</i> is a proprietary system with a funder-centric view. This means that there are often challenges in accessing and aggregating information and activities from recipient systems, given the software was tailor-made for Sweden. Accordingly, it is often difficult to get a true understanding of the impact of development aid and much of the data on the platform hasn’t been reused, for example, for building applications. To overcome these structural problems, <i>openaid.se</i> could create novel ways to combine data with other systems through the integration of new tools. Easily comparable data would lead to better impact analyses to understand the effects of aid, to more targeted and efficient innovations, more openness and accountability.</p>
    <h3>Data Privacy </h3>
    <p>The active and instant nature of publishing aid data has exposed privacy concerns among Sida staff, despite the fact that the information was publicly available before the development of <i>openaid.se</i>. This has raised the need to think about <i>how </i>transparent the site should be and what tools could be implemented to mitigate apprehensions about data privacy, including the use of unofficial notes and comments only available to staff. Staff buy-in is essential for the continued growth of the site. As such, Sida should continue to prioritize communication to staff about the values of transparency and accountability while remaining responsive to their concerns for data privacy. </p>
    <h3>Usability and Citizen Engagement</h3>
    <p>When Sida first launched <i>openaid.se</i> in 2011, user experience wasn’t a key priority. As such, the site offers limited opportunities for citizen engagement or interaction. The only feedback channel is an opinion button which people use for reporting bugs. </p>
    <p>Usability is also a concern, and project titles often contain cryptic terms that are interpretable only to those who work internally on projects, making them difficult to understand for a wider audience. As such, there is a need to raise awareness among staff to ensure the accessibility of data with outside users. </p>
    <h3>Data Licensing</h3>
    <p>During the initial development and deployment of <i>openaid.se</i>, Sweden’s data policy environment presented numerous challenges. Until May 2015, there were no specific regulations regarding open data and open data sources. The PSI Directive helped to fill this juridical vacuum in relation to the reuse of data within Sweden. Prior to the PSI Directive’s introduction, however, <i>openaid.se</i> had neither high-level policy support nor clearly defined licensing guidelines or standards. As Sweden continues to take steps to enshrine the legal right to access and reuse public data, early challenges related to clear, legal data licensing structures for <i>openaid.se</i> data should continue to wane.</p>
  looking_forward: >
    <p>In order to address the above challenges and continue to expand upon the success of the <i>openaid.se </i>hub in terms of meaningfully increasing transparency, Sweden should consider implementation of more forward-planning data and increase the functionality of the site. </p>
    <h3>Usability and functionality </h3>
    <p>While Sweden has taken significant steps to improve the usability and functionality of the <i>openaid.se </i>platform since its launch in 2011, much of the information is still too complex for lay citizens to digest in a meaningful way. Furthermore, given the funder-centric nature of the site, the opportunities for citizens to engage and interact are limited. To continue to improve upon the functionality, more intuitive data visualization and storytelling should be employed to present the large amounts of information available in a way that illustrates the impact of aid funding for the public. Tools developed by other organizations could be integrated into the current system to enable better field monitoring and evaluation. For example, tools like Water for People’s Field Level Observations Watch (FLOW)<u> </u>or distributed publishing tools like Akvo Really Simple Reporting (RSR) could be extremely effective. </p>
    <p>In terms of the distributed publishing and feedback functions, Sida should ensure they remain responsive to the data privacy concerns of staff and potentially launch functionalities to relieve tensions such as unofficial comments and notes that are only internally available.</p>
    <h3>Forward-Planning Data</h3>
    <p>The publication of more and more detailed forward-planning data by Sweden would have a huge impact on recipient countries. This could include links to project documents as well as results and conditions data for all planned activities in IATI files to promote access and use by others. This would enable greater local ownership over development results and have follow-on effects for increased accountability and governance. In its Open Government Partnership Action Plan, Sweden posits that this aid transparency will also enable full use of the available financial resources for poverty eradication and facilitate better division of labor. According to Samantha Custer of AidData, “Equipping CSOs and government ministries to use this in program planning, advocacy and research is also essential to sustaining practice.”</p>
    <p><i>Openaid.se</i> should also improve the publication and use of monitoring and performance data. Currently this data is only available in PDF format. In the future, having this data available in the IATI standard would enable the information to be integrated into an ecosystem of tools for field monitoring and evaluation, leading to a more streamlined flow.</p>
    <h3>Collaboration with Other Partners </h3>
    <p>Greater collaboration with other donors and local partnerships in recipient countries for the development and rollout of the <i>openaid.se </i>platform would be hugely beneficial and overcome some of the structural challenges the site currently faces. To that end, Sweden could work with organizations in developing countries to combine with other recipient systems for contextualized applications to enhance transparency and accountability – i.e., applications to increase citizen access to governmental aid budgets and recipients. </p>
    <p>The Swedish legal barriers to reuse the data must also be addressed to create greater impacts. Reuse has the potential to enable interested citizens to create innovative new means of combining, displaying and otherwise reusing data, which has a huge potential for rethinking and reconfiguring the way aid is currently implemented. Efforts at various levels must harmonize their efforts in order to avoid fragmentation. In order to avoid fragmentation, though, it is necessary for actors at various levels – from grassroots to ministries – to harmonize their efforts while not cutting off creative potential.</p>
    <p>Sweden’s efforts to open aid data to the public have made major strides toward increasing transparency and accountability in the field. Given the fact that much of this effort occurred during a time when Sweden lacked the type of high-level policy commitments toward enabling the reuse of open data such as those found in many other countries is particularly notable. By focusing on the usability of the aid data hub, deploying more forward-thinking data and better collaborating with partnering stakeholders, <i>openaid.se</i>’s impacts should continue to grow and broaden in the coming years. </p>

  summary: >
    <p>Corruption has been a long-standing problem in Slovakia, especially in the area of public procurement. In January 2011, Slovakia introduced a regime of unprecedented openness, requiring that all documents related to public procurement (including receipts and contracts) be published online, and making the validity of public contracts contingent on their publication. These reforms appear to have had a dramatic effect on corruption and, equally important for the business climate, perceptions of corruption. More generally, they are among the chief pillars of an effort – within Slovakia and the European Union at large – to reform governance and make it more responsive, transparent and efficient.  </p>
  takeaways: >
    <p>Key Takeaways:</p>
    <p><ul class="small"><li>Slovakia’s 2011 legislation to enforce greater transparency in public procurement stands as one of “the most dramatic transparency reforms in the world.” It improves on an earlier Freedom of Information (FOI) law and builds on successful transparency efforts at the local level, in particular in two municipalities. The success of the national law suggests the extent to which national and regional policies can be positively influenced by small-scale, local efforts.</li>
    <li>Among the most important aspects of Slovakia’s law is a move away from <i>transparency by demand</i> to <i>transparency by default</i>. Earlier FOI policies required citizens to actively request information related to procurement. Under the current law, all information is required to be made open by default, making it far easier for citizens and watchdog groups to identify suspicious patterns or other indications of corruption. </li>
    <li>Over 2 million contracts have now been posted online in Slovakia. Because these contracts are available by default to anyone with an Internet connection (approximately 83 percent of the population), procurement and more generally corruption oversight is subject to a more “diffuse knowledge” base. Earlier, a select group of highly motivated activists, journalists or politicians were generally involved in identifying instances of corruption. </li>
    <li>For all the citizenry’s newfound ability to identify corruption, Slovakia still lags when it comes to punishing corruption and enforcing accountability. This is a powerful reminder that more information and greater transparency on their own are not sufficient to change societies and political cultures. Greater openness of data and information must be accompanied by institutional reform and political motivation.</li>
    <li>Despite the impact of the legislation on making information on contracts public, this information must still be converted into “real” open data (e.g., made machine readable and accessible) in order to increase access and engage citizens, journalists and civil society. Efforts from civil society groups (particularly Transparency International Slovakia and Fair Play Alliance) are still emerging to standardize, scrape and add functionality to the existing government data to make it truly open. This, too, points to the importance of collaboration between the government and civil society. </li>
    </ul></p>
  background: >
    <p>Slovakia has long suffered from a problem with corruption. For years it was consistently ranked by Transparency International as one of the most corrupt countries in the European Union. According to a 2010 survey conducted by the Slovakian Business Alliance (SBA), corruption was identified by businesspeople and entrepreneurs as the number one barrier to doing business in the country. Corruption in public procurement was one of the areas identified as most problematic. Robert Kičina, executive director of the SBA, put it this way: “Public procurement didn’t have a sound name in Slovakia. Many people and enterprises think it is a very corrupt area. Maybe these suspicions make many entrepreneurs refuse to participate in tenders.”</p>
    <p>Early efforts to address corruption included a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) adopted in 2000. According to the Transparency International Slovakia,<b> </b>this act “became the cornerstone of … government transparency.” However, despite its good intentions, the act had several shortcomings. Most prominent among these was the fact that the act sought to create <i>transparency by demand</i>. Citizens could access information related to government contracts and projects, but that information was not made public by default – citizens had to proactively request it. Among other problems, this concept of transparency by demand made it difficult for public watchdogs and journalists to identify or notice conflicts of interest and other indications of corruption; in general, corruption could only be identified when individuals or groups already had an inkling of its existence and therefore actively request related information. In this respect, the 2011 reforms represented a clear paradigm shift, toward a notion of <i>transparency by default</i>.</p>
    <p><b>Table 1</b> includes a narrative description of some prominent cases that highlighted the nation’s corruption problem, despite the FOIA Act of 2000 and other measures. While many of these were focused on corruption in public procurement, they were in many ways symptomatic of a more general crisis of governance in Slovakia. Indeed, in late 2011 and early 2012, the country was engulfed by large-scale street demonstrations against the government. In an article on these protests from February 2012, <i>The Financial Times</i> described Slovaks as “angered” and “discontent with official cronyism and corruption.”</p>
    <p><b>Table 1: Notable Corruption Cases</b></p>
    <p><b>Contract Type</b></p><p><b>Scandal</b></p><p><b>Response</b></p><p>Construction</p><p>In 2007 the Slovakian Ministry of Construction and Regional Development published a tender request for construction services totaling €119.5 million, by only posting a hard copy on a small notice board in the hallway inside the Ministry building. As this was the inside of the Ministry building, which is not open to the public, only enterprises with pre-existing relationships with the Ministry were able to see the tender request. A firm that was known to have close ties to Ján Slota, the head of the ruling Slovak National Party, ultimately won the contract.</p><p>More than a year after the fact, the procedure came to light and was invalidated by the Slovak Office of Public Procurement.</p><p>Legal and PR Services</p><p>Also in 2007, the Ministry of Construction and Regional Development used a notice board to obtain legal and PR services. Only one consortium consisting of companies clearly connected to one of the government parties joined the tender. As a result, the state was contracted to pay €120 million over the course of nine years. A single agency logo’s price of €85,000 is especially indicative of the level of government overpayment. </p><p>After the contract was signed, nearly a year passed before a media outlet discovered and reported the corruption. At that point, Fair Play Alliance worked with media partners to request and analyze not only the contract but individual payments, invoices and other relevant documents. Given the transparency-by-demand ethos of the time, watchdogs had to rely on the courts to honor such FOI requests.</p><p>In the end, public pressure stoked by media and NGOs, and an investigative report prepared by Fair Play Alliance for the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and the European Commission forced the Minister of Development to cancel the contract in 2009. </p><p>Up to €12 million was already paid but more than €100 million could be saved thanks to those efforts. The case has also been investigated by the police and will be tried in Slovak court (though no one involved has been punished as of 2015). </p>
  project: >
    <p>The genesis of the national legislation under examination here came in response to developments at the European and regional level. First, within Slovakia, two municipalities provided important inspiration for national transparency efforts. In 2005, a group of politicians in the southwestern town of Šaľa grew frustrated by what they perceived as a lack of transparency in the mayor’s office. In response, they began publishing public contracts related to municipal business on their website. When the group gained power in city council elections a year later, they expanded these efforts, and Šaľa became the first municipality in Slovakia to publish all public contracts and receipts online. At around the same time, in the northern city of Martin, Mayor Andrej Hrnčiar, citing Šaľa as inspiration, similarly began publishing contracts and receipts online.
    These efforts proved tremendously popular, and both mayors were subsequently re-elected. They provided an indication to the nation at large of what was possible through proactive transparency efforts. In late 2010, when the Slovakian justice minister spoke to Parliament as it debated the proposed new transparency rules, she paid tribute to the groundwork laid by these two municipalities: “I think it is important to remind us that we are drawing inspiration from municipalities, who showed us that having contracts, orders and receipts published online does not cause any problems; on the contrary, it raises the trustworthiness of town leadership and also ensures effectiveness and accountability when dealing with municipality resources.”</p>
    <p>The legislation, known as Act No. 546/2010 Coll. supplementing Act No. 40/1964,<b> </b>came into effect on January 1, 2011, following an update to the EU Procurement Directives that included reforms such as reverse auction mechanisms for procurement and guidelines for centralized contract repositories. Unlike the existing Slovak FOI law, it was focused on increasing <i>active</i> government transparency and openness. Under the new law, the government was required to publish almost all contracts, receipts and orders online, regardless of whether a citizen had made an active request for information. Importantly, government contracts were not considered valid unless they were published within three months of being signed.</p>
    <p>Inevitably, there was some pushback and opposition to the law. Some of the most vocal complaints came from mayors at the municipal level who were worried about meeting the law’s various requirements, especially with their often quite limited technical and financial resources. Mayors were particularly concerned that the law required all receipts and orders in their municipalities to be made available on the Central Registry, a requirement which they saw as especially onerous. In January 2012, this requirement was repealed and now only metadata needs to be posted on the registry.
    </p>
    <p>Following the enactment of the law, a wide variety of documents was made available online. These were published both at the national level, at Central Register of Contracts (or CRZ: <u>https://www.crz.gov.sk/</u>) and at the municipal level. The documents published included virtually all procurement information, including judicial verdicts, contracts and receipts related to public entities like village schools, prisons, ministries and various other entities. Perhaps surprisingly, the technical and financial issues were minor and the entire process was completed within two months.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, concerns do remain about the scope of documents included on the portal. For example, some 20 exemptions exist to the documents that need to be posted, and these include documents related to employment contracts, national security, family life, and unemployment benefits. In addition, in response to concerns raised by state companies about the need to protect commercial interests (for example, pricing in contract documents), the exemptions also cover certain commercial information. According to Charles Kenny, the exemptions to publication have mushroomed since the portal’s launch. In addition, a study by Transparency International found that out of 1,100 state-owned enterprise and municipality contracts included in the study, almost one-fifth weren’t published in their entirety.</p>
    <p>In addition, one major limitation of the register is that it only publishes data but does not include the tools necessary to analyze that data. In response to this shortcoming, Slovak, a consortium of civil society groups, launched a new site (<u>www.otvorenezmluvy.sk</u>), built on the Central Register data that was searchable and offered a range of analytical tools<b>. </b>Contracts are now analyzed and uploaded each night.</p>
    <p><img src="static/img/studies/slovakia-0.png" /></p>
    <h4>Figure 1: Screenshot of Central Register</h4>
    <p>Despite these (and other) shortcomings, Slovakia’s law is now recognized as one of the most ambitious and proactive approaches to transparency legislation in existence. Gabriel Šipoš of Transparency International Slovakia has, for example, included it among “the most dramatic transparency reforms in the world.” Despite initial hesitations among some businessmen (concerned about publishing sensitive commercial information) and politicians (who feared a new, digital bureaucracy), support has grown since the law’s inception. As Miroslav Beblavý, a leading politician, has argued: “Unfortunately, this country needs the public sector and those in power [to] be checked by 5 million citizens of Slovakia.”</p>
  impact: >
    <p>The results of Slovakia’s transparency legislation have been striking, affecting a wide range of beneficiaries. Impact can be gauged according to four categories: engagement and use, corruption and perceptions of corruption, citizen awareness and oversight, and regional diffusion. </p>
    <p><blockquote>Intended Beneficiaries</blockquote></p>
    <p>Average Citizens</p><p>Legal framework for more efficient and transparent use of taxpayer money</p><p>Annual use of the platform is at 8 percent of the population, following a reported 11 percent in the first year.</p><p>90,000 “heavy users,” who have checked at least five public documents</p><p>Business Community and Entrepreneurs</p><p>Business associations (including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Slovakia) were largely supportive of the new legislation. </p><p>Legislation is aimed at addressing Slovakia’s difficult business climate: the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business list places Slovakia in the bottom 100 for four key indicators. Prior to the law’s enactment, corruption was identified by businesspeople as the number one barrier to doing business in the country. </p><p>Media and Watchdog Groups</p><p>Media seen as among biggest supporters and beneficiaries of new law</p><p>25 percent increase in stories on procurement in mainstream media</p><p>Increase in variety and source of “tips” received by journalists as average citizens can now identify instances of possible corruption</p><p>Overall increase in number of NGOs and scope of work undertaken by watchdog groups as a result of the legislation</p>
    <h3>Engagement and Use </h3>
    <p>Several indicators point to significant use by citizens, journalists and others of both the central register (CRZ) and documents posted at the municipal level. These include:</p>
    <ul class="small"><li><b>Contracts Published:</b> Between 2011 and 2014, over 780,000 contracts were published in an open, machine-readable format on the CRZ. A further 1.2 million were published by municipal authorities. The largest number of contracts was published by Všeobecná zdravotná poisťovňa, the main state health insurer, followed by RTVS, the national broadcaster, and Národná diaľničná spoločnosť, the state highway operator. About one-quarter of the contracts were for amounts higher than 1,000 euros, while 3 percent were for contracts over 100,000 euros.  </li></ul></ul>
    <p><b>Citizen Use and Access of Portal: </b>In the years preceding the passage of the new transparency legislation, fewer than 5 percent of citizens used FOI laws to request information from public agencies. According to surveys conducted by Transparency International Slovakia, 11 percent of the population accessed the portal in its first year of existence, followed by an average of 8 percent of the population in the following years. Together with<b> </b>otvorenezmluvy.sk, an unofficial open contracts portal run by </p>
    <p>Transparency International Slovakia and the Fair Play Alliance, the official CRZ portal attracts approximately 54,000 visits a month. Significantly, this figure has increased by a third since 2012, which suggests that citizen awareness and use of the portal data is gaining momentum.</p>
    <p><img src="static/img/studies/slovakia-1.png" /></p>
    <h4>            Figure 2: otvorenezmluvy.sk main page</h4>
    <p>A fuller picture of citizen use can be determined from Google Analytics data, provided by Transparency International Slovakia. Although the average visitor to the site spends under two minutes on the site (1m44s), 2 percent of sessions (or 170,000 visitors) spend more than 10 minutes. In addition, 20 percent of visitors are returning ones, indicating the possible existence of a committed group of transparency watchdog groups and individuals. However, Maria Zuffova, a researcher at the Slovak Governance Institute argues that the high level of returning visitors each month could actually point to a high number of individuals working in public institutions visiting the site in an official capacity, such as to upload the contracts and receipts each month.</p>
    <h3>Corruption and Perceptions of Corruption</h3>
    <p>Corruption is notoriously difficult to measure. By its very nature, it is hidden, and so challenging to capture. Nonetheless, a few indicators point to the positive impact of the law. These include:</p>
    <ul class="small"><li>In the 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index published by Transparency International, Slovakia increased its ranking by six places, to 54. This represented a jump of 12 places since 2011, making Slovakia one of the most improved countries over that period. </li></ul></ul>
    <ul class="small"><li>Transparency International’s index relies on <i>perceptions</i> of corruption. But some more objective indicators also suggest the law’s impact. For example, while only 2 percent of tenders were conducted electronically prior to the law, almost half are now done that way. In addition to increasing transparency, this has also led to more competitive bidding – an average of one additional bidder per contract, which in turn decreases the contract price by around 2-3 percent.</li></ul></ul>
    <li>The competitiveness of bidding on public contracts can be considered a proxy for corruption. Between 2010 and 2014, the average number of bidders on public procurement contracts more than doubled in Slovakia – from 1.6 companies to 3.7 companies.</li></ul>
    <li>The European Research Centre for Anti-Corruption and State Building (ERCAS), citing studies conducted by the Sunlight Foundation, concluded in 2013 that “overall, the Slovakian case supports the idea that transparency may be necessary, but not sufficient, to fight corruption effectively.” The ERCAS identifies areas of progress as a result of the new legislation, but also cites compliance and implementation (subjects we discuss below) as areas of remaining concern.</li></ul>
    <h3>Citizen Awareness and Oversight</h3>
    <p>Making available information on procurement is only a first – if important – step. The impact of Slovakia’s reforms will ultimately be determined by the extent to which citizen and civil society groups use that information to enforce accountability on their leaders. In this regard, early indications are encouraging. Media reporting on procurement has increased substantially since the passage of reforms (by 25 percent over the last four years, according to<b> </b>one report), and Slovakia has also witnessed a noticeable increase in activity by watchdog groups and NGOs that work to limit corruption. As Eva Vozárová from the Fair Play Alliance notes: “Accessing contracts has become a normal source for journalists and civil society groups.”</p>
    <p>The transition away from a transparency-by-demand approach to transparency by default has had a particularly powerful effect on the way citizens and watchdog groups identify instances of corruption. Previously, corruption had to be proactively identified through FOI requests, often by individuals or groups who had a certain amount of pre-existing knowledge. Under the new system, however, corruption can be more “passively” identified, for example by citizens who happen to notice apparent irregularities while perusing contracts online. This has led to a far greater number of tips, often passed on by ordinary citizens to journalists, who in turn investigate and call for accountability.</p>
    <p>Overall, there has been a move toward what one report calls a more “diffuse knowledge” – a greater number of actors, from a greater diversity of backgrounds, is involved in policing corruption. This diffusion of oversight, away from a select group of corruption fighters to the citizenry at large, is perhaps one of the most important impacts of Slovakia’s 2011 transparency reforms. </p>
    <h3>Regional Diffusion</h3>
    <p>As with many of the case studies examined in this series, the success of this particular open data effort is also indicated by its regional impact. Slovakia’s transparency reforms have been widely hailed as models for Europe and beyond. While it is difficult to assess whether an idea is being explicitly emulated, or if an idea’s time has simply arrived, many of the specific steps included in those reforms are occurring in neighboring states:</p>
    <ul class="small"><li>In August 2011, Slovenia passed legislation making it mandatory to publish certain types of procurement contracts. According to the Slovenian Government Commission for Prevention of Corruption, this legislation was, as in Slovakia, a direct result of political frustration with corruption, particularly at the level of government contracts and tenders. Moreover, such frustration had been legitimized in 2010 by a government analysis of Public Payments Administration data that revealed high levels of corruption.</li></ul></ul>
    <p>The outcome of this legislation was a portal called Supervizor, which provides information on the business transactions of public sector bodies, including legislative, judicial and executive entities; community-level agencies; public institutes and more. The project was developed by the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption of the Republic of Slovenia and partners in the Slovenian Ministry of Finance, the Public Payments Administration of the Republic of Slovenia and the Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Public Legal Records and Related Services. The portal at present contains data going back to 2003 (just prior to Slovenia’s joining the EU) and indicates various types of information, including that on contracting parties and larger recipients of funds. Data is available in graph or printout form for specified time periods. Its content has been described by one reporter as “a breath of fresh air.”</p>
    <p><img src="static/img/studies/slovakia-2.png" /></p>
    <h4>Figure 3: Supervizor main page</h4>
    <p><blockquote> </blockquote></p>
    <ul class="small"><li>In 2015, the Czech Republic passed a similar amendment to its Act on Public Contracts, as well as a Decree on Publication of Notifications, which is believed to be based, at least in part, on the Slovak law. These laws define new guidelines for state contract tender auctions, and all signed contracts for a certain portion of responsible subcontractors must be released to the public. Contract information is now required to be published on the nation’s procurement data portal, Věstník Veřejných Zakázek. The Government of the Czech Republic has identified “the computerization of invoices in the state sector and the transparent disclosure of expenditure paid from taxpayers’ money, including small-scale contracts” as among its key priorities. </li></ul></ul>
  challenges: >
    <p>Slovakia has travelled a great distance in its efforts to increase transparency, reduce corruption and improve governance. The reforms it has undertaken are a striking example of how more open and accessible information can have powerful societal, economic and political effects. </p>
    <p>Nonetheless, the nation’s transition to a more open and transparent society is still underway, the reforms themselves remain a work in progress, and much work remains to be done. If Slovakia is to continue along the path it has set itself, several challenges need to be overcome. The following three are among the most important:</p>
    <h3>Data Quality</h3>
    <p>For all the amount of information on public procurement available (over 2 million contracts have now been published), the quality of that information remains a concern. According to a survey, approximately 10 percent of published contracts in Slovakia have at least one piece of key information missing. Another study found that a quarter of contracts had a “subject” missing, 12 percent were missing price-related information, and in 4 percent of contracts the name of the counterparty was redacted. Civil society groups in Slovakia complain that they spend an inordinate amount of time and resources cleaning data, often posting it on their own sites or unofficial portals; the public’s interests would be better served by directing those efforts at analyzing documents and identifying questionable transactions.</p>
    <p>The public’s ability to search and analyze contracts is also limited by an absence of metadata and inter-linking between different databases (for example, databases containing tender notices and invoices and receipts related to that tender). Furthermore, amendments to contracts are often published in isolation, without linkages to the original contract, making it difficult to understand the full context or history of a particular procurement process.</p>
    <p>Civil society has played a vital role in transforming <i>public</i> data on procurement into <i>open</i> data that is machine readable and accessible for public consumption. As Eva Vozárová and many journalists involved in open data during the past decade have noted, even when government data is published, it often is not available in usable formats. In other words, the data is still not fully open: It is dispersed across various websites, not available for download, and limited in searchability or standardization (that would enable, for instance, cross-database comparisons). </p>
    <p>The otvorenezmluvy.sk portal mentioned above, run by Transparency International and the Fair Play Alliance, plays a vital role in supplementing this government data. Its administrators scrape data from government registers and add functionality, including full-text search, basic analytics and the ability to red-flag possible errors or problematic contracts. Transparency International Slovakia’s Open Procurement Portal similarly builds on the available public procurement data and “visualizes procurement expenditures by procurers, suppliers, sectors and regions, as well as provides downloadable structured procurement data in bulk.” These added functionalities allow for both organizations to conduct broader analyses of government data across key variables. </p>
    <h3>Cost (and Perceptions of Cost)</h3>
    <p>When the legislation was being debated, one of the chief concerns was the potential cost of the reforms. Smaller municipalities in particular were afraid of what some termed a new “digital bureaucracy.” The concerns were primarily related to human costs, as the financial costs of building and maintaining the contracts portal (and other associated sites and technology) have been negligible: a mere EUR 20,000 to set it up and an additional EUR 3,000 to maintain it, according to the estimation of one involved technician (another EUR 4,500 were spent to update the portal over the first four years).</p>
    <p>In fact, according to a study conducted by Transparency International Slovakia, the human and administrative costs have not proven unduly burdensome for most municipalities. Admittedly, in some cases, particularly in those regions with outdated software or hardware, it has been something of a challenge to upload and maintain records of all contracts. In addition, certain institutions (e.g., cemeteries, dormitories and organizations involved in the supply of water) have, for various reasons, found it harder to comply with the legislation. The authorities have responded in many cases by increasing the number of exemptions under the law, allowing those for whom compliance has proven particularly burdensome to avoid uploading certain records.</p>
    <p>In some cases, exemptions have been and should continue to be granted to certain types of organizations. However, these should be granted cautiously and judiciously, since, as described above, there is concern about an excess of exemptions having been granted since the law’s inception. </p>
    <h3>Enforcement and Accountability (The Human Factor) </h3>
    <p>Slovakia’s law has in many respects been exemplary in the way it emphasizes transparency. Repeatedly, journalists and civil society groups have been able to use the law to shine light on cases of corruption that would probably have remained hidden before the new legislation.</p>
    <p>Yet paradoxically, Slovakia is also illustrative of another key principle: that transparency on its own is not enough. Media organizations and watchdog groups have consistently made the point that, even when instances of corruption are brought to public attention, they often go unpunished. The strengthening of transparency has not been accompanied by a similar increase in enforcement or institutional capacity to enforce accountability. As Peter Kunder, from the Slovakian Fair Play Alliance, notes: </p>
    <p>One lesson that we learned from publishing data … is that it is critical and totally important to have the state publish the data but it is only one part of the success. The second part is that other institutions in the society and other aspects in the society need to work – judiciary, police and public pressure – and that is nowadays a bigger problem in Slovakia than the publishing of information.</p>
  looking_forward: >
    <p>In order to address the above challenges and maintain momentum brought about by legislation and access to data toward meaningfully reducing corruption, Slovakia should consider a number of pathways.</p>
    <h3>Cross-Sectoral Collaboration Around Data Quality</h3>
    <p>Greater collaboration among civil society groups and government is vital to improvements in data quality and making public data more open. Ongoing quality checks through such a collaboration could help ensure that published data is complete and usable. Additionally, such collaborative portals would allow citizens to participate in scrutinizing the data and reporting errors. </p>
    <p>Additionally, the development of automated data quality checks could help mitigate issues surrounding the data. The UK Health & Social Care Information Center, for example, uses an automated process to clean a variety of hospital episode statistics.</p>
    <h3>Training and Identification of Best Practices</h3>
    <p>With much of the required technical infrastructure already in place, attention should be paid to the “human factor” – training staff, ensuring they are supplied with the right equipment, and facilitating exchanges of knowledge between different municipalities to establish best practices and other guidelines for using the contracts portal.</p>
    <h3>Monitoring Compliance</h3>
    <p>To help ensure ongoing accountability, Slovakia could consider creating an agency within the government focused on monitoring compliance in contracting, perhaps in collaboration with NGOs like the Fair Play Alliance and Transparency International. Such an agency should be empowered to impose punitive (and criminal) sanctions where warranted.</p>
    <p>The solution cannot, however, simply lie with new institutions. Existing institutions like the police and judiciary need to be modernized and trained to enforce the letter and spirit of the country’s transparency legislation. All arms of the state need to work together.</p>
    <p>Until now, public pressure has often stood in for the state and enforced accountability when formal institutions have refused to take action. The public (including citizens, NGOs, watchdog groups and media organizations) will remain critical in ensuring accountability, and must thus receive support and encouragement. In part, this means maintaining a broader ecosystem of free expression, dissent and the right to demonstrate, a goal toward which Slovakia continues to make progress, though challenges remain – such as the wide use of defamation suits by the powerful to silence dissent and whistle-blowing. Robust protections for such civil liberties are a vital part of ensuring political accountability in any society.</p>
    <p>Slovakia has unquestionably taken significant steps toward combating corruption through a dual-pronged approach built around legislation and technology. While the actions taken to date have shown great promise and, indeed, appear to be having an impact on corruption in the country, they should be seen as first steps along a much longer path of openness, accountability and citizen involvement. </p>

  summary: >
    <p>Kawal Pemilu (“guard the election,” in Indonesian) was launched in the immediate aftermath of the 2014 presidential elections, as the country was riven by political polarization and the two leading contenders for the presidency traded allegations of vote rigging. Faced with this delicate moment in Indonesia’s ongoing process of democratization, a globally dispersed group of technologists, activists and volunteers came together to create a website that would allow citizens to compare official vote tallies with the original tabulations from polling stations. These tabulations were already made public as part of the Elections General Commission’s (KPU) commitment to openness and transparency. However, Kawal Pemilu’s organizers played a critical role in assembling a team of over 700 volunteers to digitize the often handwritten forms and make the data more legible and accessible. The site was assembled in a mere two days, with a total budget of just $54. Its overall impact was to enable citizen participation in monitoring the election results, increase public trust in official tallies, and more generally, help ease an important democratic transition.</p>

    <p>Key Takeaways:</p>
    <p><ul class="small">
    <li>Successful open data projects rely and often build on a pre-existing government commitment to openness and transparency. But open data enthusiasts and activists can play a critical role in taking already-released information and making it more accessible.</li>
    <li>When given the opportunity, citizens are willing and able to play a role in digitizing and analyzing data in order to ensure that government is working properly. Kawal Pemilu demonstrates the importance of crowdsourcing, in its various forms.</li>
    <li>Successful open data projects do not require huge budgets or a centralized team. They can be built on a shoestring budget, by dispersed and nonhierarchical teams that may largely consist of volunteers.</li>
    <li>Open data projects that threaten the status quo must guard against hacking and other security attacks. This is an especially important consideration given the rapid and ad hoc nature of many of these projects, which naturally increases their vulnerability. </li>

    <h3>Corruption in Indonesia</h3>
    <p>Public demand for transparency, accountability and better government in Indonesia has been growing rapidly since the “Reformasi,” a movement for political reformation that began in the 90s. In spite of this, corruption remains a problem in the country. According to Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, Indonesia ranked 107 out of 175 countries in 2014. Its Bribe Payers Index ranked Indonesia 25 out of 28 countries in 2011. According to the World Democracy Audit, Indonesia ranked 88 out of 150 countries in terms of corruption in 2014.</p>
    <p>Corruption has also been evident in the electoral process, and both the 2004 and 2009 elections were characterized by alleged irregularities. Perludem (www.perludem.org), a nongovernmental association for election and democracy in Indonesia, reported instances of money politics, manipulation of vote counts, intimidation and officials taking advantage of government positions to add candidates or campaigns. As Diah Setiawaty, Perludem program manager for election application programming interface, puts it: “Candidates used to routinely bribe voters. They bribed them with money, with rice and with other food products.” Observers also note that Indonesia’s electoral process is particularly prone to vote manipulation, due in large part to its size and complexity. “Our election system is one of the most complex in the world,” says Setiawaty. “It has to accommodate over 100,000,000 registered voters and a complicated geography that includes over 17,000 different islands. It is huge and it all happens in one day.”</p>
    <h3>Open Data and Indonesian Elections</h3>
    <p>In 2011, Indonesia joined the Open Government Partnership (OGP), emphasizing a national commitment to budget transparency and more efficient public service delivery. In 2014, Mardianto Jatna, Assistant to the Head of the Presidential Delivery Unit for Development Monitoring and Oversight (UKP4), declared a “Year of Open Data.”  Several initiatives were undertaken as part of this Year of Open Data. One was the launch of the Indonesia Data Portal, which publishes approximately 700 sets of data from 23 government institutions.  </p>
    <p>Another particularly significant open data effort was the Elections General Commission (KPU)’s move to begin sharing all election-related data on the Internet. The KPU is a quasi-governmental body whose mandate is to ensure transparent and fair elections. In April 2014, amid urgent calls from citizens and political parties on all sides to improve transparency and safeguard the presidential elections due later that year, it announced its decision to share election data on its official website (www.kpu.go.id/).  </p>
    <p>The political mood during that year was particularly polarized. It was the first time in Indonesia’s history that just two candidates were running (typically, three or more run). In addition, the candidates’ backgrounds and profiles were dramatically different: Probowo Subainto had a military background and was associated with the former Suharto regime, while Joko Widodo (Jokowi) belonged to a more recent generation and came from a more civilian background. According to Perludem’s Diah Setiawaty, the polarization of voters was magnified by their increasing presence on social media. Indonesia had the fourth-largest number of Facebook users in the world in 2014, and Jakarta was the most active city in the world in terms of Twitter participation in 2012. </p>
    <p>It was against this background that the KPU made its decision to publish the voter tabulation forms from various levels of the Indonesian voting process. Voting in Indonesia is manual; citizens vote at one of more than about 470,000 polling stations. The results are then tabulated at six different levels: the polling station, the subdistrict, the district, the city regency, the province and the national. Each level uses a different form, and the time between actual voting and national tabulation can be very long. The potential for fraud – for example, by manipulating results along the way – is huge. Initially, in April 2014, the KPU announced that it would open up and make accessible the results tabulation forms for levels 2-6. However, this left out the all-important polling place tabulation form (the so-called C1 form) from the first level (i.e., the actual location of voting). After further pressure from civil society groups and some political leaders, the KPU announced in July 2014 that it would also make the C1 forms available. These forms were then scanned and published on the KPU’s website, offering<b> </b>citizens and the media an unprecedented level of scrutiny over election results.  </p>
    <p>The KPU’s initiatives have been widely praised. Ainun Najib, one of the founders of Kawal Pemilu, says: “I really have to commend the KPU for this move. It was a huge step toward improving transparency in Indonesia’s election system.” Nonetheless, the KPU’s initial efforts were in some respects incomplete, and have since been supplemented by citizen efforts. For example, the scanned C1 forms were filled out by hand and published in a non-machine-readable format (usually JPEG or PDF); often, these forms were hard to decipher, and sometimes published upside down.</p>
    <p>To address these (and other) problems, a number of independent, citizen-launched applications and websites emerged around and since the 2014 presidential elections. The first such application appeared almost immediately after the July 11 election, when a Twitter user with 7,000 followers began posting the scanned C1 forms. Other applications followed, each monitoring different portions of KPU-opened data: Some filled the gap in machine-readability by digitizing the scanned C1 forms and making them more accessible; other applications dealt with district, city/regency and province-level scanned forms, monitoring results at those voting levels; and yet another category of citizen-led applications examined scanned C1 forms for problems or anomalies. Kawal Pemilu, the application under study here, was among the most successful initiatives in this surge of citizen-led voting applications.</p>
  project: >
    <p>During the summer of 2014, Ainun Najib, who would later go on to co-found Kawal Pemilu, was living and working in Singapore. It was the middle of Ramadan, and he was down with the flu. Still, he was following the elections closely in his native Indonesia, and watched with growing concern as the extreme polarization that had characterized the campaign spilled over into the post-election period, and as the results were contested by both the Jokowi and Probowo camps. </p>
    <p>Amid allegations of fraud and vote rigging, Najib began looking at ways he could add more transparency to the electoral process. “We [had to do something] to prevent the nation [from] being ripped apart because of two claims to victory that nobody can verify,” he told <i>The Financial Times</i>. Around this time, he messaged a friend, Andrian Kurniady, a Google employee based in Sydney; Najib had met Kurniady in 2007 at a Mathematics Olympiad Champions competition, and though they were not close friends, they were connected on Facebook. The two quickly decided to work together to help safeguard Indonesia’s vote count. Later, they were joined by three other friends, who worked with them to get the application off the ground.</p>
    <p>In its early days, Kawal Pemilu tried to fill machine readability gaps in KPU data by digitizing scanned C1 forms and using handwriting recognition to extract the polling data. They quickly ran into obstacles with this approach, however, and soon decided to turn to a form of crowdsourcing. Specifically, they decided to recruit volunteers to manually digitize the almost 500,000 scanned C1 forms on the KPU site. This was the genesis of Kawal Pemilu (“guard the election,” in Indonesian), which was launched on July 12, 2014, with the intent of providing a platform for public participation in guarding the 2014 general election results. As Andrian Kurniady, Najib’s co-founder, put it at the time: “We hope this system can reduce the uncertainty, fear of election fraud, and restore public confidence in one of the most important points in Indonesian democracy [while it] is still young.”</p>
    <p>The Kawal Pemilu application consists of two main components. At the back-end, it includes a private, walled-off website, where volunteers and site administrators can enter polling data based on scanned forms (Figure 1). In addition, there is a public-facing site that allows citizens to view the data, broken down by polling station and candidate (Figure 2). Visitors can choose to view results for different levels of the tabulation process. For example, a visitor can choose to examine just C1 results. Results can also be viewed by region. </p>
    <p>The underlying data for the site was generated from KPU data through a network of volunteers spread across the globe. Volunteers were recruited through a closed, secret Facebook group, which ensured that only trusted people were included. To start the process of recruiting volunteers, each founder chose 10 trustworthy friends, each of whom was asked to recruit 10 more, and each of those was also asked to recruit another 10 friends – and so on. Over 700 volunteers were recruited in this way in just three days. Volunteer names and identities were initially kept hidden, to prevent any efforts at bribing or intimidation. </p>
    <p>Each recruit received a secret link to the<b> </b>nonpublic component of the website, where scanned C1 forms were presented with an accompanying form for the volunteer to fill in with extracted data. The form also allowed for the reporting of errors. The results of this work were posted every 10 minutes to the public-facing website, which was read-only. In addition to allowing citizens to monitor election results in near real-time, this data also allowed them to compare vote tallies listed on the site to official numbers released by polling stations. </p>

    <p><img src="static/img/studies/indonesia-1.png" /><blockquote>Figure 2: Screenshot of the public-facing Kawal Pemilu website (translated into English by Google)</blockquote></p>
    <p>The entire process of building the site and gathering all the data was performed with remarkable efficiency. Because the co-founders were spread around the world (California, Sydney, Singapore, Indonesia, Netherlands, Germany), they were able to work round-the-clock, taking maximum advantage of different time zones. This enabled them to create the website and counting system in just two days. In addition, all the recruited volunteers and founders worked without pay. The total capital investment for the setup was, as a result, just $54; these funds were used to purchase the website’s domain and space on a hosting server. Overall, Kawal Pemilu is an impressive example of a “public-service startup”: Despite never benefiting from seed capital or a Silicon Valley-style business ecosystem, it was put together with all the agility and speed that are the hallmarks of far more lavishly funded business ventures. </p>
  impact: >
    <p>Kawal Pemilu was one of many crowdsourced vote count initiatives launched around the time of the 2014 elections, and built on KPU data. Others included Kawal Suara (“guard the votes”), Real Count and a Tumblr site called C1 Yang Aneh. However, Kawal Pemilu stands out as one of the most efficiently built and managed, and one of the most effective initiatives. In an article on “Indonesia’s election tech fighters,” one Indonesian<b> </b>reporter described the site as “the most professionally run” among various efforts.  Kawal Pemilu has also been described as a “leading spearhead in monitoring and legitimizing the [2014 electoral] vote count outside the state apparatus.”</p>
    <p>The impact of Kawal Pemilu can be measured in several ways: </p>
    <p><b>Settling the 2014 Election Results</b></p>
    <p>By the fifth day after the 2014 elections (four days after the site’s launch), Kawal Pemilu volunteers had digitized 470,000 or 97 percent of all scanned C1 forms. In fact, volunteers had competed against each other to scan the highest number of forms, spurring the rapid and efficient process described above. Based on these numbers, Kawal Pemilu (and citizens accessing the site) was able to establish that the vote count was in fact very similar to the official KPU result (53.15 percent for Joko Widodo and 46.85 percent for Prabowo Subianto), which was at the time being contested by the Prabowo camp.</p>
    <p>A month after the elections, the vote tallies were still being contested, and the results were taken to court. Kawal Pemilu played an important role in the court hearings, and its testimony – along with that provided by KPU officials and other expert witnesses – helped influence the court’s decision to award the elections to Jokowi. In this way, the crowdsourced election results helped settle the elections, legitimize the winner and, more generally, ensure a peaceful transfer of power in Indonesia. </p>
    <h3>Increased Trust and Greater Public Participation</h3>
    <p>Beyond its direct impact on the 2014 elections, Kawal Pemilu has also had an overall effect on Indonesia’s electoral process and political climate, helping to increase transparency and public trust. As Uuf Brajawidagda, a lecturer of Indonesian politics at the University of Wollongong in Australia, who studied Kawal Pemilu and similar Indonesian open data initiatives, puts it: “Projects like Kawal Pemilu catalyzed the level of trust among citizens. The KPU move [to open election related data] increased trust, but Kawal Pemilu and others like it transformed the trust into something bigger. Their actions amplified the level of trust.”</p>
    <p>The greater public trust has, in many ways, translated into a new sense of citizen involvement and stakeholdership in Indonesia’s political process. The sense of involvement is most evident in the more than 700 volunteers who helped crowdsource the KPU data. But observers also note a more general sense of empowerment and new expectations of transparency. As Perludem program manager for election application programming interface at Perludem Diah Setiawaty, put it: “Kawal Pemilu created a movement – a movement toward increasing open data and transparency in Indonesia. It set the bar really high.” <b> </b>As evidence, Setiawaty cited the numerous open data initiatives that have followed Kawal Pemilu (see below for details), and the energy she experiences around these initiatives. “Indonesians are definitely more eager and willing to participate in crowdsourced applications now,” Setiwaty says. “They want to participate in the political process.”</p>
    <h3>Reduced Polarization</h3>
    <p>Kawal Pemilu emerged at a time of intense polarization in Indonesia. One of its most important (and perhaps long-term) effects may be to reduce the climate of partisanship and political division. Observers note that, because it presented an independent, verifiable and nonpartisan snapshot of the election results, it helped heal some of the mistrust and mutual suspicion among rival political camps. “I think it closed the gap between the two groups,” said Brajawidagda. “It made people feel better about official results, even if those results contradicted their personal outcome preferences.” As evidence, Brajawidagda cites some of the comments he saw posted on social media – comments that point to people’s faith in the final results, regardless of their political leanings. One example he cites is the following comment: “Unbelievable, kawalpemilu (final count) deviates only 0.01 percent. Great. ... This is the real count.” Overall, Brajawidagda feels that, in helping validate the election results, Kawal Pemilu played an important role in fostering a more civil political climate in Indonesia.</p>
    <p>Perludem’s Setiawaty agrees. “Politics were still very polarized after Kawal Pemilu,” she says. “But the mood was less negative. People could see things from a more objective perspective.”</p>
  challenges: >
    <p>What happens next for Kawal Pemilu and, more generally, for Indonesia’s political climate? Despite the early successes of initiatives like Kawal Pemilu, corruption remains a serious problem in Indonesia, and ample scope exists for improvement in the electoral process. In order to truly change conditions, Kawal Pemilu (and other similar projects) will not only need to scale significantly but also prove that they can grow and last beyond a single election. If that is to happen, a few challenges will need to be overcome.</p>
    <h3>Legal Changes</h3>
    <p>In fact, the KPU’s move to open up election data in 2014 was just a temporary measure, without any lasting legal foundations. Following the success of Kawal Pemilu and similar applications, there has been a general clamor calling for legislation to require opening of election data for all future elections. The organization Perludem has played a key role in pushing for new legislation and in drafting versions of the proposed law. Setiawaty of Perludem says: “Kawal Pemilu was a definite success, and in addition it has increased the probability of new election laws in Indonesia that emphasize transparency.” So the prospects for new, more-encompassing legislation are bright – but until it is passed, the cause of greater transparency in Indonesian politics, and more specifically applications like Kawal Pemilu, will continue to face challenges.</p>
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>As<i> </i>with any anticorruption project, Kawal Pemilu has come up against some powerful vested interests. Soon after it was launched, some of those vested interests appeared to strike back. Four days into its existence, the site was attacked by what administrators called “hundreds of hackers.” As a consequence, the site was brought down for a few hours, until the project’s administrators returned a “logic bomb” to their attackers. In addition, administrators ran a mirrored version of the public site, to limit the potential damage from hacking.</p>
    <p>The identity of the hackers remains unknown, but they were mostly believed to be located within Indonesia, and they were widely considered to be responding to the website’s growing legitimacy and popularity. In this sense, the hacking attempts were just a particular instance of a more general effort to hijack the project or weaken its credibility. For example, in the early days of the Kawal Pemilu, the project’s founders went to great lengths to hide their identities (and those of their volunteers), in an effort to thwart attempts at bribery or intimidation. Such threats are only likely to grow as Kawal Pemilu and other popular initiatives seek to take on the establishment and increase transparency in Indonesia. </p>
    <h3>Reliability of Information</h3>
    <p>In its early days, Kawal Pemilu experienced some skepticism about the reliability of its data. This skepticism was heightened by the anonymity of its volunteers – ironically, because the anonymity was in fact designed to decrease their susceptibility to untoward influence and was thus a way of ensuring reliability. Ainun Najib says organizers regularly fielded questions from the public about accountability and verification of inputs. He and the rest of the team always took the time to explain their methodology, and to point out that all the data was verifiable within the site itself. Indeed, visitors to the site can click on any piece of information and find the underlying, original scanned form, all the way down to the C1 form from the initial polling station, as proof. In that sense, Kawal Pemilu contains an internal process of legitimization – which helps overcome (if not entirely do away with) public skepticism or doubts.  </p>
    <h3>Lasting Political Impact</h3>
    <p>Any issue- or event-focused project faces questions about its survivability and sustainability over time. For Kawal Pemilu, the question is not only whether the project can survive, but what form it can take in the long term. The same factors that permit such initiatives to emerge quickly and rapidly – their decentralized, ad hoc nature – often make it difficult to grow into larger organizations. The founders of Kawal Pemilu are well aware of these challenges. They say they don’t have answers yet, but are exploring strategies to ensure the long-term sustainability of Kawal Pemilu. </p>
  looking_forward: >
    <p>The example offered by Kawal Pemilu has inspired several other open data initiatives that aim to increase transparency and reduce corruption in Indonesia. In some ways, we are witnessing the emergence of a new, citizen-driven open data ecosystem in the country, one whose aims can broadly be defined as improving governance and enhancing democracy.</p>
    <p>This ecosystem is likely to grow more vibrant in coming years, and several new applications and websites are already starting to make their presence felt. Here, we highlight three of the most promising.</p>
    <h3>Kawal APBD</h3>
    <p>Following his involvement with open data and elections, Kawal Pemilu co-founder Ainun Najib has launched a new site that aims to improve budget transparency and open it up to citizen involvement. His new project, Kawal APBD (<u>www.kawalapbd.org</u>) places different versions of government budgets side by side and allows citizens to find and comment on discrepancies. For example, in one case, the site helped find a discrepancy between the South Jakarta department of education and the education section of the city budget. In addition to commenting on discrepancies, citizens can also “like” or “dislike” budget allocations, and visualize data, thus helping them better understand the budget process. </p>
    <p>The goal of Kawal APBD “is to make more government data accessible and presentable for people,” said Mr. Najib. “We already knew through Kawal Pemilu that people would participate. We hope more and more government data is going to be exposed to the public.”</p>
    <h3>Mata Massa (“Eye of the Masses”)</h3>
    <p>Mata Massa was in fact launched before Kawal Pemilu, in the run-up to the 2014 elections. It allows citizens to report campaign-related and other violations through their smartphones to the General Elections Monitoring Body (Bawaslu). For example, citizens have reported instances of vote buying, as well as other administrative violations. Overall, some 1,500 violations have been reported (though reports indicate that little follow-up action has in fact been taken). Originally launched to monitor the trustworthiness of journalists, the app was created and is run by the Alliance of Independent Journalists in Indonesia. </p>
    <h3>Kawal Pilkada </h3>
    <p>Kawal Pilkada sought to replicate Kawal Pemilu’s effort to crowdsource digitizing of KPU C1 forms for regional elections in December 2015. The project is built around the same concept as Kawal Pemilu, but under different leadership. There are several challenges here. One is in terms of recruitment. While citizens are eager to participate, crowdsourcing is more challenging than it was in the Kawal Pemilu experience. Diah Setiawaty, whose team provides technical assistance to the Kawal Pilkada team, says there is less intrigue overall in these regional elections, and voters know and care less about leaders in other regions. Kawal Pilkada also faces a time constraint. The KPU only recently announced it would publish related tabulations online, so the Kawal Pilkada team has little time to prepare. Another constraint going forward is the frequency of regional elections, which occur every two years. “For each election, there is a lot to monitor at the same time. The political situation in every region is different. We face different challenges in every place,” says Setiawaty.<b> </b></p>
    <p>Taken together, these and many other existing and emerging applications make up a new landscape for open data, transparency and accountability in Indonesia. They demonstrate that data can be used by ordinary citizens to hold government accountable, and, although many of them remain modest, more proof of concept than full-blown national platforms, they suggest that a citizenry empowered with information can indeed effect genuine political transformation.</p>

  summary: >
    <p>A broad variety of services depend on accurate, up-to-date address data, including emergency services; the police; postal and transport services; and GPS systems. In 2005, the Building and Dwelling Register of Denmark started to release its address data to the public free of charge. Prior to that date, each municipality charged a separate fee for access, rendering the data practically inaccessible. Other entities, such as the Cadastre, the Land Registry, the Central Business Register and the utilities sector, collected their own address information, leading to significant discrepancies between the content held across different databases. A follow-up study commissioned by the Danish government estimated the direct financial benefits alone for the period 2005-2009 at EUR 62 million, at a cost of only EUR 2 million.</p>
  takeaways: >
    <p>Key Takeaways:</p>
    <p><ul class="small">
    <li>In highly open, transparent societies, the opening of government data can be successfully justified and driven by expected economic benefits from increased efficiency and innovation within government, without the need for political arguments for transparency.</li>
    <li>Relatedly, efforts to collect and open data can uncover major gaps and deficiencies in official government data sources, creating benefits to internal efficiency and recordkeeping, often with little to do with improving transparency or accountability. </li>
    <li>There is a need to establish robust and carefully planned governance models for data collection systems, and skills for data collection among those charged with collecting it, to ensure the resulting data set is clean, accurate, usable and widely used.</li>
    </ul></p>
  background: >
    <p>Denmark is a high-income constitutional monarchy in northern Europe with a population of 5.6 million in 2015. It is ranked 10th on the United Nations Human Development Index. Locally, the country is divided into five regions, which are further subdivided into 98 municipalities, reduced from 270 in 2007. </p>
    <p>Denmark is considered, both nationally and internationally, among the most highly open and free countries in the world. The country was ranked second on the 2014 Global Open Data Index by the Open Knowledge Foundation, ninth on the 2015 Open Data Barometer and fourth on the World Justice Project’s Open Government Index. The Danish media is considered free by Freedom House, and the country is ranked third in the World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders. Consequently, corruption is not widely considered a problem in Denmark.</p>
    <p>Denmark is a signatory to the Open Government Partnership. It began the process to join in September 2011, and is currently implementing its first Action Plan and developing its second, which has open data as one of its four themes. The Action Plan expresses the government’s intention to develop an Open Data Innovation Strategy (ODIS), to draw attention to the potential of public data and make it accessible. ODIS will also operate the public data catalogue and facilitate communication between public sector and private reusers of data.</p>
    <p>Despite its wealth, Denmark has found itself under increasing pressure to find ways to control government spending. Danish citizens are among the most highly taxed in Europe, but there is little public appetite for government program cuts. Nonetheless, according to OECD data from 2011, the Danish government spent over a quarter of its GDP (26.1 percent) on social spending, compared to an average of 21.7 percent across OECD member countries. The OECD also found that 26.8 percent of the labor force was employed in the government sector (excluding public corporations) in 2012, and compensation for these employees consumed 19 percent of GDP, the highest percentage in the OECD. Faced with an aging population and fewer taxpayers, a real prospect of government spending reaching unsustainable levels, and a population reluctant to embrace budget cuts, the Danish government has had no option but to look for ways to improve government efficiency.</p>
  project: >
    <p>Before 1996, address data was registered and collected individually by the 270 Danish municipalities. Although public data was available, organizations wanting to access the data had to make separate access and pricing agreements with each municipality, rendering the data practically inaccessible. The lack of an accessible, unified public data set resulted in the development of several private databases of varying quality. Furthermore, there was no consensus on the definition of an address, or who (if anyone) held the reference address file, with users such as Post Danmark and the emergency services each holding rival data sets.</p>
    <p>Appreciating that there would be considerable practical benefit to a single standardized address system, with each address datum attached to a unique geographic point, officials at the Danish National Survey and Cadastre (now the Danish Geodata Agency) began a pilot program coordinating this already-collected data into a single body. Morten Lind, business manager of the Danish Address Program at the Danish Geodata Agency, describes the origins of the program: “We started as a pilot project in 1996, where we said, there’s a potential in having good address data, and in taking addresses and giving them a geographic coordinate so that we know where each address is. If every government agency has its own separate address database, we are not sure that we can actually compare things. So we had this idea of making a common reference data set where we could say: These are the addresses that exist. [And] it was clear that the only party that could create this reference file of addresses was the local authorities.” </p>
    <p>In order to do this, the Danish National Survey and Cadastre decided to adapt the existing building and dwelling register, with minor adjustments, as the primary address register. The local authorities would collect the data, assign and register addresses and street names, and would have responsibility for and ownership of the data, while the Danish Survey and Cadastre would coordinate the project. At this point, the submission of data was voluntary, and municipalities could not be compelled to supply address data, but some financial support was offered to help municipalities with compliance. Lind and a colleague from the Danish organization of local authorities also met with local authorities throughout the country to promote the project. </p>
    <p>The potential interest and utility of the data set quickly became apparent to those working with it. A project manager at the Ministry of Housing, Urban and Rural Affairs commented: “It did not take many years after starting to work with the public data in around 1993 to realize that these data could be used for many interesting things. And we felt it was a shame … that the data weren’t used more.”</p>
    <p>By 2001, the data had been collected in a single register owned by the local authorities. Potential users such as the police, emergency services, public health agencies, public transportation companies and agencies like the Danish Ministry of the Environment and county administration were aware of and eager to use the data to provide their services armed with a more accurate understanding of the locations of homes, businesses and other entities, but, as Lind explained, the next hurdle was finding an agreement on how it could be accessed and used. “The police want[ed] to use it, the Ministry of the Environment want[ed] to use it, but ... we had almost 300 local authorities that could decide their own pricing models on a completely individual basis. We couldn’t foresee that an agreement could be reached [on] a price [for] address data. So we were in a deadlock. ... We had a lot of very good data but nobody used it.” Some government agencies tried to access the data via individual agreements with each local authority: “a very cumbersome process even for a large organization.” </p>
    <p>The deadlock was eventually broken through the intervention of the Minister of Finance. Analysis by the Ministry of Finance’s eGovernment Taskforce had identified address data as one of the data sets with the most potential use, leading the Minister of Finance to broker an agreement on access and use with municipalities. This agreement, officially called the Better Access to Public Data, but more widely known as the “free of charge agreement,” would make available data from the Cadastre and municipal property and dwelling registers, which comprised address data and their associated geographic coordinates, free of charge through a government portal, with those accessing it paying only the cost of distribution. Although the Danish National Survey and Cadastre had advocated this solution, the outcome was, Lind concedes, surprising, since the government was at that stage committed, by policy and legislation, to selling its data. </p>
    <p>The efforts and influence of Lind were crucial in advancing the cause of opening the data. He had succeeded in convincing his superiors at the Danish National Survey and Cadastre of the necessity of opening the data without charge, since an agreement on pricing seemed elusive, and this became the agency’s position. He and his colleagues had involved potential users and stakeholders in pressing for the release of the data through a series of meetings and conferences at which the benefits and opportunities of the data set were explained. “It was very important for us to do that because we had to put ourselves on the agenda for the Minister of Finance, [who] has many important issues to solve, and this one was only a little one.” Post Danmark was also, according to Lind, a major driver behind the decision to open, having declared early on that they wanted to rely on public data. Significant users such as Post Danmark and the emergency services have subsequently provided important feedback on how the data set could be improved.</p>
    <p>The agreement came into effect on January 1, 2003, but legal issues delayed its full implementation until 2005, when an amendment to the law governing the Public Data Server removed the legal restrictions on the distribution of address data to third parties, as well as the fee for distribution. The release was not conceived of as an open data project, according to Lind: “‘Open data’ ... was not a term we used then. We used the term ‘data free of charge’ ... [but] really it lives up to almost all of the definitions of open data today.” There would be no restrictions placed on the use or redistribution of the data beyond those required to satisfy the requirements of the law, particularly in regard to personal data or product marketing. Steps should continue to be taken, however, to ensure that such restricted, privacy-eroding activities are not being undertaken by internal or external users of the address data. </p>
    <p>The municipalities were compensated EUR 1.3 million for loss of income from sales of data for the three years after the agreement was reached. At that point, the agreement offered them the opportunity to renegotiate for further compensation, but no further negotiations were sought by the municipalities. The compensation did not fully recompense the municipalities for the costs of data collection, but, as Lind notes, the data already had to be collected for their own use. “Our position was that the data was there, and of course we needed to have an assurance that the data will be updated, and of course there would be costs associated with this updating … but this is something that the local authority has to do, agreement or not.” The money offered was, instead, a compensation for no longer being able to sell the data. In addition, Danish Enterprise and Construction Authority (DECA), the agency responsible for road names and addresses in Denmark, calculated that the municipalities would realize savings from no longer having to negotiate data purchase agreements, deliver data or enforce licenses. </p>
    <p>Beyond the local authorities themselves, which were the biggest users of the address data, the primary intended users of the data set were the public sector. Emergency services, public health disease prevention programs, national and county environmental agencies, public transport companies and Post Danmark were all expected to make use of the data set. Journey Planner, a then groundbreaking Web app allowing people to plan journeys using public transportation from one address to another, also relied on the address data set. Input from intended users was sought through nationwide conferences and informal meetings between the Danish Survey and Cadastre and potential user groups such as the police.</p>
    <p>Although the developers were aware of the potential benefits of the address data set for the private sector, Lind maintains that this benefit was always secondary to the desire to improve public sector efficiency and services. “We were of course aware that [this data] could have large benefits for the private sector in geomarketing, logistics, transport planning, route planning, and analysis of where to locate a new store, and so forth … but that was not our selling argument. Our argument was the public sector. We have data that enables the public sector to be more efficient and to provide better services for citizens and for business, and it’s stupid that we don’t use that data.”</p>
    <p>As far as its developers were aware, the Danish address data set was the first of its kind to be compiled and opened free of charge. Lind reports that they were influenced by a similar data set, Address-Point, compiled in the United Kingdom by the Ordnance Survey. Address-Point took the Royal Mail’s Postcode Address File (PAF), and attached geographic coordinates, creating a unique geolocated identifier for each address. Address-Point was, however, a commercial data set owned by the Ordnance Survey, and was not open. Moreover, the PAF which enabled the development of Address-Point was controversially sold at the time of the privatization of the Royal Mail. In March 2014, the chairman of Parliament’s Public Administration Committee argued that, “The sale of the PAF with the Royal Mail was a mistake. Public access to public sector data must never be sold or given away again.” Lind recalls, “I think we were totally on our own in deciding that the only possible model could be opening the data free of charge. I’m proud of that situation.”</p>
  impact: >
    <p>The opening of the address data set was, almost universally, enthusiastically received, and the data set widely used. According to DECA, in 2009 address data was delivered to a total of 1,236 public and private parties, including 286 full, nationwide address sets. This response was based on feedback from only 14 of the 22 data distributors, and therefore underrepresents the total number of deliveries. Of these deliveries, about 70 percent were to the private sector, 20 percent to central and regional government, and 10 percent to the municipalities. Of the 286 nationwide address sets delivered, 12 were for IT products with more than 1 million end users.</p>
    <p>We have data that enables the public sector to be more efficient and to provide better services for citizens and for business, and it’s stupid that we don’t use that data.”</p><p>– Morten Lind, Danish Geodata Agency</p>
    <p>The exceptions to this warm response were a small number of private vendors with agreements to supply competing address data to municipalities, who were unhappy with the decision to open the public data, since it cut off a source of revenue. The majority, according to Lind, embraced the opportunity to get out of data collection. “The more future-minded of these companies said, we are happy not to use our efforts in collecting these data. We want to use our efforts in making applications [and] value adding onto the data, ... and making something more intelligent.” GPS and navigation companies were likewise happy to abandon data collection and adopt the open address data set, according to Lind. </p>
    <h3>Direct Financial Benefits</h3>
    <p>According to a 2010 study commissioned by the DECA, the direct financial benefits to society of the open address data for the period 2005-2009 totaled EUR 62 million through especially improved government back-end capabilities and more efficient service delivery. The total cost for the program over the same period was EUR 2 million, comprised of EUR 1.3 million in compensation to municipalities and the balance in costs to distribute the data through the Public Data Server (PDS). The benefits of the agreement in 2010 were expected to be EUR 14 million, while total costs would be EUR 0.2 million for distribution of the data through the PDS. Approximately 30 percent of the benefit was to the public sector, with the remainder to the private sector – including, notably the nongovernment Post Danmark, which saw major efficiency increases based on access to the data. The study only measured direct financial benefit to those receiving address data via one of the PDS’s 22 distributors, and did not attempt to place a value on the supplementary benefits derived further down the distribution chain through secondary and subsequent reuse, except to suggest that they are “very considerable.” </p>
    <p>To illustrate these subsequent benefits, Lind points to the ubiquity of GPS systems, used by nearly half of all Danish households, and reliant on the open address data set. According to Lind, GPS companies interviewed by the Danish Geodata Agency report that they consider address data in Denmark the best in Europe. “We were able to improve the precision of car navigation systems in Denmark, and this has second-level impact on competitiveness and not using too much petrol.”</p>
    <h3>Nonfinancial Benefits</h3>
    <p>The Danish emergency services, who were among the early users of the open address data set, introduced a system built on standard car GPS navigation systems into 1,200 emergency vehicles, in preference to more expensive mobile devices for alarm reception and tracking, with resulting significant reductions in cost, response times and fleet efficiency. The opening of the address data also improved response accuracy for the emergency services within Denmark. Lind notes that the increased precision of the geocoded address set improved the capacity of emergency services to find the right address. “The public could be more confident that 1-1-2 [emergency] services would be able to find them, and … we had a really great impact on that.”</p>
    <p>Not all anticipated benefits of the free-of-charge agreement were realized, however, although often these reflect a failure to embrace the data, rather than deficiencies within it. For example, the DECA analysis of the benefits of the address data set reported that adoption of the official address data set by the Central Business Register had been slow, and that in 2010 companies employing approximately 15 percent of the Danish workforce were registered at an address that was not in the official data set. As a result, DECA reports users found that it could take months or years for a new or changed commercial address to appear in their GPS. Given that emergency services as well as clients and suppliers rely on GPS to find commercial locations, the implications of such delays are potentially very costly.</p>
    <h3>Benefits to Developer Community</h3>
    <p>The number of applications using national address data went from two or three in 2005 to over 500 by 2009, according to Lind. </p>
    <p>“The multiplication of use was astonishing. There has been a lot of development … in geomarketing and digitization, and each development shows new use cases for the address data. I think that’s the purpose of open data. Originally you collect it with a purpose – hopefully! – but when you put it out into the open, you will experience new usefulness of the data that you haven’t foreseen. Perhaps you will find that there are purposes that you haven’t even thought of, that have an even better business case [with] more benefit than you have estimated from your original [case]. By going into the open data agenda, you have to say to yourself: I don’t have the faintest idea what this can be used for! It’s not up to me to decide … or to control.” </p>
    <h3>The Danish Basic Data Program</h3>
    <p>One of the most significant impacts of the release of the Danish address data was the impetus it gave to open other public data sets. Given the documented benefits of opening Danish address data, the Danish eGovernment strategy from 2011-2015 expanded the program with Good Basic Data for All, commonly known as the Danish Basic Data Program.</p>
    <p> Basic data is essential information used repeatedly by the public sector in case processing, such as personal and company registration numbers, addresses, cadastral data and physical and political mapping data. The Basic Data Program consists of a set of seven subagreements between multiple ministries and agencies, involving a total of nine registers, including business registers, the Cadastre, the Building and Dwelling Register, administrative and geographical boundaries, map and elevation data, place name and information register, and the register of property owners. A final subagreement covered the implementation of a common platform to disseminate the data from the other subprograms.</p>
    <p>While personal data is protected by Denmark’s Act on Processing of Personal Data (2000), all other data within these registers was opened for access and reuse by individuals, the public sector and private companies as of January 1, 2013. Between 2013 and 2015, the agencies involved improved and expanded the nine official registers supplying basic data, with the aim of developing a “high quality common administrative foundation … efficiently updated at (a) single site.” Implementing the Basic Data required the harmonization and conversion to a common format of all existing registers that would supply data; the addition of extra information to the basic data registers to better support public administration, and the development of a common infrastructure to distribute the data, the Data Distributor.</p>
    <p>The Basic Data Program did not come about as a result of public pressure, demand from potential users or a desire for transparency. A project manager at the Danish Agency for Digitization interviewed by Thorhildur Jetzek in 2012 noted: “We believed in [transparency] but it was not going to open any doors in Denmark. Because in Denmark we didn’t really have the feeling that our government wasn’t transparent enough. We never really seemed to regard that as a serious issue for Denmark.”</p>
    <p>Instead, the Basic Data Program was developed as a result of a business decision to improve public sector efficiency and data quality, influenced by New Public Management reforms over the last two decades in which improving efficiency became the focus of efforts to control spending without increasing taxation. Jetzek reports that initially there was resistance in some quarters to the idea of fully opening the data, rather than simply finding ways to improve the efficiency of its collection, management and use, while continuing with the prevailing model of offering data for sale, as mandated in Danish law. The decision-makers involved were ultimately persuaded to open the data by the experience of open data projects in the Netherlands, and by the work of Dutch analyst Marc de Vries, who argued that the income from data sales was typically a fraction of the actual costs of collection, while the economic benefits of opening the data could be up to 17 times that cost. The Pricing of Public Sector Information Study carried out by de Vries and others in 2011 for the European Commission concluded that only reducing charges to zero or cost-recovery increased data reuse by 1,000 to 10,000 percent, attracted new users such as small and medium enterprises, and increased economic activity, market dynamism, innovation, employment and efficiency, with little impact on cost.</p>
    <p>The advent of Denmark’s Basic Data Program also coincided with a new government in 2012 that responded to the worldwide economic crisis with a focus on job creation and innovation. Although opening the data was a means to improve efficiency, rather than an end in itself, there was no conflict between efficiency, innovation, and open data ideals. Lind notes, “We could align the purpose of the Basic Data Program to make government more efficient with open data ideas [of] making the basic data open for the private sector and citizens to make smart things.”</p>
    <p>As intended, the Basic Data Program has provided opportunities for the private sector. Septima, a geodata startup, was founded around the same time as the Basic Data Program in 2013. It offers a range of products and services using the data, including data enhancement, such as calculating the distance between schools and houses; Web-based map components and search tools for public data; consulting to organizations like the Geodata Agency; and subcontracting to the large IT company involved in developing the distribution platform for the Basic Data Program.</p>
    <p>Bo Overgaard and Christian Fischer of Septima note that some of the company’s work would have been possible without the Basic Data Program, but that the Program opened up possibilities for products and services that had not previously existed. </p>
    <p>“[The Basic Data release] was part of the basis of us establishing our company, that now we [could] do some interesting things with all the new open data sets.” These new opportunities included the possibility of speculative development, without the need for a customer. “[The Basic Data Program] has been a great help to us. Before, our clients had to have the rights [to the data]. Now we can develop our products without having a customer. We can get the data, [make] some nice products and show them to potential customers. It also [enables us] to do different business models. Before, the license was connected to a user, and if you wanted to make a mobile application, you had to buy a site license, which could be very expensive.”</p>
    <p>Since the establishment of the Basic Data Program, the private sector market for this data has grown. More companies like Septima have been established, and existing companies that had not previously worked with geodata have moved into the sector. According to Overgaard and Fischer, this development has spawned a lot of interesting solutions. It has become standard for insurance companies, for example, to use elevation data to assess risks of flooding where they would previously have had to rely on aggregated risk by region. Municipalities are also using this data to model and plan for flooding risk as sea levels rise. </p>
    <p>Jetzek observes that the impact on the private sector is harder to quantify. “There are a few companies in Denmark that you can say were founded on the basis of the Basic Data Program, but I think most of the use is, and will continue to be, companies that are using the data and a thousand other things in their daily processes. For most companies, it’s hard to say exactly what effect it would have if the data were not available, or if [they] were more expensive.” She reports that the Danish Geodata has been attempting to track the impact of its data releases over time, with a baseline survey conducted in the year the Basic Data Program began, and follow-up surveys planned for future years.</p>
    <p>The frequency with which data sets are updated varies according to the register. Some elevation data relies on aerial surveys that might be a decade old. Data in the address data set, by contrast, is continuously updated as new addresses are added by local authorities. It takes seconds after addresses are locally created for the information to become available as part of the national data set. “Fifteen seconds after an address is recorded [by] a local authority, it is available in our service, and that’s very important if you are making e-government for GPS. A delay of one to two weeks would be a problem. For e-government, if you go to one part of government and make an address it should be available instantly for the next purpose.”</p>
  challenges: >
    <h3>Data Quality</h3>
    <p>Once the decision to open data for the Danish Data Program was made, the challenges became those of data quality and governance across the range of agencies and registers. Jetzek notes that the nature of the data collection has created significant variability in quality. </p>
    <p>“In Denmark, data collection is very distributed, and in most cases the data is just a part of what they do: a necessary part, but not the main part. Making some standards or blueprints for the organizations to follow when they’re going to model or open the data is very important. Some agencies like the Geodata Agency are very professional data custodians: They’ve done it for a long time, and there are standards across Europe, and there’s a lot of knowledge and professionalism. ... Whereas others … don’t even know what the data model is. The data is just something that someone is keying in somewhere, and then they have this register. It’s very important to have some common understanding and some common skills about how … we handle all this data ... [but] this skill [isn’t] common in the public sector. …. We haven’t really focused on data as a key resource.”</p>
    <p>Overgaard and Fischer observe that accuracy appears to be higher in areas where data collection is directly connected with government revenue by comparison with areas in which data is an incidental by-product of another activity. “If money is directly involved, the quality tends to be good. The building and dwelling register, for example, is involved in taxation, and it’s pretty precise.” The business registers, by contrast, which are not directly involved in revenue collection, are much more error-prone. Both Jetzek and Overgaard and Fischer cite weaknesses in the register of companies where the nature of the business is described: The company itself is listed, but the nature of its commercial activity is wrong. “In the business register, the businesses are supposed to say what they do, to classify the business, but you can look at the register and see that a pizza shop is classified as a shoemaker because the house used to belong to a shoemaker, and then it changed … and nobody [corrected] the data.” Some uses that Septima had hoped to make of the data from the business register, for example, turned out not to be possible because of deficiencies in the quality of the data. </p>
    <p>Having been open longer, the address data set has had longer to address these quality concerns. The aim of the address data subprogram was “to further improve the quality and accessibility of address data, and enrich … the infrastructure behind the distribution of address data.” The Geodata Agency has also collaborated with OpenStreetMap to identify and correct address errors in the data set. One of the greatest boons to accuracy, however, is simply opening the data and having it used, which provides opportunities for scrutiny and correction – what de Vries calls a partial outsourcing of quality control – and raises the quality of the data set. “Address data is very good in Denmark, and that’s because so many are using them. If no one uses the data, then no one finds the errors,” note Overgaard and Fischer. Centralization of registration also allows for easier and faster correction, since users only have to report errors and omissions once, through a portal that connects users with the responsible municipality. With the Basic Data Program, the address data set also “took an extra step toward the open,” according to Lind, by removing the earlier distribution costs and making the data easier and cheaper to access and use. “Every citizen can now download a data set of every address free of charge, or access our services for a Web application.” </p>
    <h3>Governance of the Data Project</h3>
    <p>Project management issues also arose over the governance of the program, which was initially similarly distributed and collaborative. The number of entities involved in the governance of the project created major complexities and management challenges. Delays occurred when the development and implementation of the Data Distributor was much more complicated than originally expected, overran its timeline and began to impede progress elsewhere. “This kind of project needs to be handled like infrastructure,” says Jetzek. “If you want to have an initiative that covers a lot of different data sets, it [is] really important to think about how you govern this. It’s hard to do it top-down; it’s also almost impossible to do it bottom-up. There has to be a middle way.” Jetzek notes that, in response to the difficulties encountered, the governance structure of the Basic Data Program was altered to make it “less democratic.”</p>
  looking_forward: >
    <h3>Expected Benefits of the Basic Data Program</h3>
    <p>At launch, the expected benefits of the Basic Data Program were efficiencies to government of about EUR 34.8 million from 2020 through decreased administrative costs, of which two-thirds of the benefit (EUR 23.5 million) would be to municipalities. The release of the data was also expected to generate returns in the private sector of up to EUR 67 million, through the encouragement of new digital services and products, and the removal of bureaucratic barriers and data costs. Finally, individuals would benefit from increasingly improved and integrated public services. </p>
    <h3>Addressing Capacity Issues</h3>
    <p>Lind identifies secure funding as the main future challenge of the Basic Data Program and projects like it. “One of the issues with open data is that you have to have a stable, sustainable source of funding … to be able to update, and to ensure the long-term quality of the open data. We [were] lucky that the Danish Basic Data Program came at a time when we needed funding of this kind. If we could have done anything differently or better, we should have focused on getting better [long-term] funding. This reorganization of government process we have just been through shows how easily things can change, and suddenly you can be without any source of funding.”</p>
    <p>For Jetzek, the major future challenge is developing skills in data collection among public servants. “Getting the data to be really clear and easy to use, so that it’s used widely across the public and private sectors and in business-critical processes, is a huge accomplishment on its own. If you want the data to be really used across the public and private sectors for more than just creating an interesting visualization or one-off something, I think you really need to focus on [data collection].”</p>
    <p>The Danish effort to consolidate and share address data has already had major impacts on the country, particularly in inspiring a much larger effort to open and consolidate all types of public data. To enable ongoing impacts, though, work must be done to engender readiness – in the form of adequate funding and employee training – within the public service, a common theme across global efforts to create impacts through the opening of data. </p>

  summary: >
    <p>Charitable data from the Canada Revenue Agency’s information return has been available to the public since 1975. In 2000, the Charities Directorate of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) began making information from the T3010 Registered Charity Information Return from organizations with charitable status available online and by CD-ROM on request, and, in 2013, all data sets since 2000 were transcribed and made available online via the government’s data portal under a commercial open data license. The resulting data set has been used on its own and in combination with other data by sector groups and academic researchers to explore the state of the nonprofit sector, improve advocacy by creating a common understanding between regulators and charities, and create intelligence products for donors, fundraisers and grant-makers.</p>
  takeaways: >
    <p>Key Takeaways:</p>
    <p><ul class="small">
    <li>Government is not the only sector about which open data can create broad impacts related to transparency and accountability. There is broad interest in and appetite for giving the public a greater understanding of the traditionally obscured financial dealings of nonprofits.</li>
    <li>Open data – even in situations that are largely focused on transparency and accountability – could stand to provide benefits to organizations releasing the data. In the nonprofit sector, for example, actors whose financial activities place them in higher standing in the public eye – particularly in comparison to demonstrated bad actors – stand to benefit from increased citizen trust and, likely, more donations and volunteerism as a result.</li>
    <li>Bringing more people to the table in tracking the activities of large organizations – particularly when that tracking can be done through large-scale data analysis – can uncover major instances of corruption or fraud. Not only can openness lead to <i>more </i>eyes on relevant data, but it can also lead to the <i>right </i>eyes on the data – i.e., making the data accessible to the people with the specific knowledge needed to recognize troubling discrepancies.</li>
    </ul></p>
  background: >
    <p>Canada is a developed, high-income North American nation with a population of 35.8 million in July 2015. It is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, and is officially bilingual (English and French). Canada had the world’s 15th highest nominal per capita income in 2014, according to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Canada was ranked eighth globally in the 2014 UN Human Development Index. Its economy is the 11th largest in the world.</p>
    <p>Canada is ranked highly on measures of government openness and transparency, civil liberties and press freedom. It is ranked eighth on the 2015 World Press Freedom Index by Reporters without Borders, and its press was considered free in 2015. In 2014, it was ranked 10th worldwide in the Corruption Perception Index by Transparency International.</p>
    <p>Canada signed the Open Government Partnership in 2011, and is now implementing its second action plan, which envisages advances in three streams of activity: open data, open information, and open dialogue. As part of its April 2012 action plan, the Government of Canada committed itself to the development of an Open Government Licence to replace existing licenses on open government data and remove restrictions on the reuse of Government of Canada data. The Open Government Licence has been adopted by the governments of Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario, as well as by the federal government. Canada is also a signatory to the G8 Open Data Charter, which commits countries to a policy of open by default. The government of Canada releases data sets on its data portal, open.canada.ca, which had 244,640 data sets available for download in September 2015. </p>
    <p>Recent Canadian federal budgets have also contained commitments to advancing open data. The 2014 Canadian federal budget pledged CDN$3 million over three years for the creation of an Open Data Institute to be based in Waterloo, Ontario. Once established, the Institute will be charged with aggregating large data sets, helping with the development of standards for interoperability and encouraging the development of new data-driven apps. This initiative is being driven by the Canadian Digital Media Network, a federally funded Centre of Excellence for Commercialization and Research responsible for supporting Canadian ICT companies and entrepreneurs, and encouraging their collaboration with research institutes, governments and other organizations.</p>
    <p>Canada has the second-largest nonprofit sector per capita in the world after the Netherlands. The 2014 Canadian federal budget states that there are over 86,000 registered charities in Canada. As of 2009, core nonprofits (those other than hospitals, colleges and universities) accounted for 2.5 percent of Canada’s annual GDP, and growth in this sector outpaced the Canadian economy for six of the 11 years between 1997 and 2007. The nonprofit sector generated nearly six times more value than the automotive industry, and employed 1.3 million people.  </p>

    <p>Section 149.1(15) of Canada's Income Tax Act obliges the government to make information contained in a public information return available to the public, although the form in which this information is released is left to the discretion of the Minister. Organizations with registered charitable status in Canada are currently required to file an annual T3010, or Registered Charity Information Return, within six months of the end of the fiscal year. The 10-page form, which is similar in content to the US 990 tax return, asks the charity to disclose its domestic and international charitable activities, revenue totals per type of source (e.g. government, foundations, donors), expenditures, charitable gifts, and non-partisan political activities. </p>
    <p>Since 1967, Canadian charities have been required to make application to a central registry and file annual financial and operational reports with CRA. The T3010 itself was introduced to replace earlier returns in 1997, and substantially revised in 1999, and again in 2009, after consultation with the third sector through the Voluntary Sector Initiative. Another revision in 2012 increased reporting requirements for charities involved in political activities.</p>
    <p>Most of the data collected have been made public since 1976, when an amendment to the Income Tax Act required all registered charities to file an annual public information return outlining their income, donations received, gifts made, costs of fundraising, overhead expenses, and salaries. According to David Lasby, Director of Research at Imagine Canada, an umbrella group that supports and advocates for Canada’s charities, as the form has been expanded over time, more information has become open, thanks to an implicit “open by default” position. “Back all those many years ago when they wrote the legislation, they built in the public information return component. The initial return was not terribly detailed, but as the return has become more and more detailed, [the additional material] has in the main been considered to be part of the information return and is publicly available. This was open data before open data ever existed.” The minority of data not made public touches on personal confidentiality: Lasby notes, for example, that the open data set includes the total amount of cross-border funding received by an organization, but that names of individuals and organizations providing that funding are withheld.  </p>
    <p>The information was originally made available upon request on paper, and then on data tape during the 1990s. In 2000, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) began making data from T3010 available to the public online through the Charities Internet Display System (CIDS), and by CD-ROM upon request, in comma-separated value (CSV) format. Those requesting the data were able to reuse it with CRA permission, but the data available online was only updated twice annually, limiting its commercial usefulness. </p>
    <p>In 2013, T3010 data for 2012 was transcribed into machine-readable format and released with a commercially friendly license on the government’s open data portal, open.canada.ca. The 2013 data were released the following year, and 2014 data are expected to be released in early 2016. In addition, the released data included digitized records of all gifts from charities and foundations, instead of only the first 10 such gifts on each T3010, as had previously been the case. More frequent updates, issued about once a month, are still available on CD-ROM by request from CRA.</p>
    <p>Although Canada’s T3010 resembles the US 990 in many respects, the digitization of the Canadian dataset renders it much more commercially useful than the US dataset, which is only available in image PDF format. The T3010 data set contains a digitized, machine-readable record of all gifts from charities and foundations, something no other country provides.</p>

    <h3>Benefits to Charities</h3>
    <p>Outside of government, probably the heaviest users of the T3010 data set have been charities themselves. One of the earliest nonprofit users of the data set, Imagine Canada, has been working with the data since the early 1990s. In the beginning, the data was used as a population count of charitable organizations, and an indicator of the key areas covered by the T3010, such as the charitable activities, revenues, expenditure, size, location and distribution – enabling a macro-level view of the philanthropic sector that still provides value today. Over time, Imagine Canada’s use of the data has become both heavier and more complex. “I use [the T3010 data] for everything from a sampling frame for survey work, to … a data source for answering policy-relevant questions, to being able to tell people what’s going on in the charitable sector in a given province. It looms large in every data-driven thing we do. You’re essentially talking about the vital statistics of every organization that’s in our key stakeholder area. … We use it in our business processes; we use it to understand what’s going on in organizations we don’t have direct contact with, but are actually responsible for … as a charity that seeks to serve the interests of other charities. Basically, almost every person in the organization on a daily basis touches the data, [although] a lot of the time they don’t realize it. ... I have the T3010 database open probably nine days out of 10.” </p>
    <p>A typical research project involving the data set for Imagine Canada was an examination of charity financing and its variability according to the size, subsector and activity type, and region. The project provided a benchmark for the organizations themselves, and allowed them to describe their particular situation to stakeholders and policymakers. </p>
    <p>“Policymakers look at the charitable sector and they see the data in the aggregate: where all of the money comes from and where it goes to. Organization leaders see it more from the perspective of where their specific organization gets its funding, and what the norms are. So policymakers look at the sector and say, wow, government funding plays a huge role. Charitable leaders look at the sector and say … well, most of that funding actually goes to a relatively small number of organizations: most of us are highly dependent on earned income and gifts and donations.”</p>
    <p>Imagine Canada has also combined the T3010 data set with other data, including IRS 990s, foundation annual reports, social media and data mined from websites, to create a by-subscription Canadian directory to foundations and corporations, now called Grant Connect.</p>
    <p>Grant Connect offers searchable information on grant prospects available to Canadian organizations, with detailed descriptions, giving histories and biographies of decision-makers. The data is verified by Imagine Canada with the grant-makers to ensure accuracy. According to Imagine Canada, the service had over 1,000 subscribers in October 2015.</p>
    <p>Philanthropic Foundations of Canada (PFC) is also a heavy user of the data set. A member association of nearly 130 charitable grant-makers, almost of all of whom are charities themselves, PFC has two mandates: to support the growth of effective grant-making philanthropy through services such as professional development, publications and conferences for members and nonmembers; and to advocate for the field, and for the growth of philanthropy in Canada. In support of these aims, PFC carries out research and collects data, both independently and in collaboration with organizations like Imagine Canada, with whom it recently produced a report on the top 150 grant-making bodies in Canada. PFC also relies on the basic biographical data from the T3010 – dates of establishment and registration, membership of the board of directors, and financials – in its business processes, using it to develop an overview of organization applying for membership, ascertain the eligibility of applicants for membership, and verify members’ reported assets and grants in fee calculations.</p>
    <p>Lasby notes that one of the benefits of the T3010 data set has been the creation of a common set of facts in discussions between the charitable sector and government. “Because so much of the [T3010] data is public, when we’re having policy discussions with government, we are, in the main … talking about the same data that we can both have access to and both parties can see. … What this [data set] is tremendously useful for is getting all of the stakeholders on the same page … without multiple competing realities.” The data set also allows advocates to demonstrate the impact of the charitable sector to legislators, through the number of employees and revenues. The data also allows the presence of the sector to be represented spatially: StepUpBC has used the data, for example, to map nonprofit organizations in British Columbia.</p>
    <p>Both Imagine Canada and CRA have employed the T3010 data to assist the public in finding, researching and giving to charities. CRA encourages potential donors to search for and investigate charities before donating through its Charities Listing search tool,, which uses the T3010 data set. Working in partnership with CRA, Imagine Canada has built on the data set to offer Charity Focus, a tool that provides in-depth, year-to-year financial information about charities for potential givers. Charities can also augment the information available on Charity Focus by uploading their annual reports, program information, and mission and financial statements.</p>
    <h3>Enabling New Streams of Research</h3>
    <p>Despite the relatively small number of Canadian researchers engaged in studying the charitable sector, the academic community has also made use of the data to examine charity financing and other econometric questions. </p>
    <p>Peter Elson, a researcher in community development at Mount Royal University and the University of Victoria, has used the data to map the location of charities and compare it to socioeconomic data on prevalence and extent of poverty in those areas. He has also examined the ways in which T3010 data captures policy implementation and charities’ engagement in public policy, and the changes in patterns of giving brought about by the introduction of donations of shares. Elson has also used the data set to examine the rate and patterns of voluntary deregistration, largely among faith-based charities as churchgoing declines. He was also the founding coordinator of the T3010 user group, a group of academic and other users who consult with the CRA on changes and improvements to the form. François Brouard of Carleton University is the current T3010 user group coordinator and has used the data to conduct research on the fundraising activities of small charities and on changes in fundraising behavior over time. Other academics have used the archival data from the T3010 data set to depict the changing demographic of Canadian charities.   </p>
    <h3>Creating a New Business Asset</h3>
    <p>The open availability of the data set has encouraged startups interested in developing intelligence products for charities. Ajah, a Montreal-based data company used T3010 data to develop Fundtracker, an online research tool that assists nonprofits to identify, research and approach potential funders. Ajah began scraping the data from the CRA website in 2010. “The CRA didn’t know what to make of it,” Ajah CEO Michael Lenczner reports. “Initially they had a statement on the website saying they didn’t support scraping instead of accessing the data by CD-ROM.”</p>
    <p>Emboldened by Treasury Board support for open data projects like theirs, Ajah continued. In 2011, it launched Fundtracker. In addition to the T3010, Fundtracker drew on multiple open sources of government and charitable data – federal and provincial government spending; charity financial and grant records and annual reports; and corporate social responsibility reports – to provide a comprehensive and searchable database of potential funders. By cross-referencing the T3010 with other data, Ajah has been able to amass an unparalleled database on the nonprofit sector, which it used to build Fundtracker, but also as a survey frame for other inquiry through its nonprofit consultancy arm, PoweredByData.</p>
    <p>Within Canada, the availability of the data set has resulted in more companies competing to help the nonprofit sector use the information than in the US. “In the US, there are two companies,” says Lenczner, “In Canada there are five.” Experience gained working with the T3010 data set has enabled some of these Canadian companies to enter and compete in markets where the data has not been opened, and is not as easy to access. A British Columbia company, Metasoft, has entered the U.S. market and competes with the Foundation Center to provide fundraising intelligence to the nonprofit market there. According to Lenczner, the opportunity to hone their skills, and their software, on a freely accessible and reusable data set gives Canadian companies a competitive advantage. Having developed the software and an understanding of what is possible using this data, they are able to go into markets where the data is not open, and scrape the data from annual reports and other sources to provide the same service. Lenczner notes, “There’s not a lot of … little plucky startups [in the US] doing this, because there’s a lot of upfront costs. I would not be doing this in the U.S. at all.”</p>
    <h3>Financial Benefits for Government and Identification of Tax Evasion</h3>
    <p>Although the intended benefits to government of the T3010 were administrative, the opening of the data has yielded some unexpected financial benefits. A contractor using T3010 data from 2005 to analyze charitable foundations in greater Toronto uncovered evidence of massive tax fraud, in which illegally operating charities in the Toronto area sheltered CAN$500 million in 2005 alone. A later newspaper investigation suggested that the fraudulent donations amounted to almost CAN$1 billion per year, with $3.2 billion illegally sheltered, a sum equivalent to 12 percent of annual charitable giving in Canada. The exposure of the fraud led to systematic closure of charity tax shelters. Writing about the impact of open data on the tax evasion scandal, nonprofit researcher and open data advocate David Eaves comments, “When data is made readily available in machine readable formats, more eyes can look at it. This means that someone on the ground, in the community … who knows the sector, is more likely to spot something a public servant in another city might not see because they don’t have the right context or bandwidth.” </p>
    <p>Lasby notes that the experience has enabled those working with the data to develop signatures for potential tax evasion, but at the time the tax evasion was missed because those overseeing the data simply were not looking for it. In addition, the community of T3010 data users was too small and technologically unsophisticated at the time to provide additional oversight or analysis. “This data is so variable that it’s hard to spot behavior that looks aberrant. It looked completely aberrant in the rear view mirror, once you know to look for it [but] at the time, I wasn’t constructing a lot of longitudinal data sets. Now it’s completely the norm for me to put together a ten-year slice. [We] didn’t have the capability back then, [or] the statistical or informational horsepower.” He notes that those working with the data would be more likely to pick up anomalies now, but that the pool of analysts is still small, and not well integrated. Comparing it to the massed debugging capacity of the open source movement, Lasby notes, “What we have right now … is a lot of parallel play. We all build data sets, we all work with it in our isolated rural splendor. We do talk to each other, and share information both formally and informally, but it’s not systematic. We tend not to share data sets.”</p>
    <p>More controversially, information from the T3010 was also used by the former Conservative Government to target certain organizations, notably environmental and human rights charities and left-leaning think tanks, for lengthy and costly tax audits of their political activities. Regulations since 2003 prohibit charitable organizations from spending more than 10 percent of all expenses on political activities., The 2012 revision of the T3010 added a new question and schedule requiring charities to disclose whether they had participated in political activities, including making gifts intended for use for political activities, and whether they had received funds from outside Canada for political activities. It also asked them to describe their political activities and how these related to their charitable purpose.</p>
    <p>Between 2012 and 2016, the CRA, with $13.4 million in special funding, was charged with reviewing political activities of charitable organizations that reported that they engaged in political activities or recorded expenses for political activities on their T3010. In 2014 the CRA was auditing the political activities of 52 groups, many of whom had been critical of the Conservative Government’s environmental and aid policies. As of March 31, 2015, 21 audits had been completed, another 28 were in process, and a further 11 were expected to be carried out before the end of the review in 2016. These audits had resulted in six education letters, eight compliance agreements, five notices of intention to revoke charitable status, one voluntary revocation and one annulment. Revocation of charitable status carried crippling consequences for organizations, stripping them of their power to issue tax receipts, and therefore cutting them off from an important source of funding. Charities complained that those audited were being drained of resources through the demands of compliance with the audit, while the threat of audits had created an “advocacy chill,” where charities self-censored in order to avoid being audited., Furthermore, organizations making grants to other charities for political activity were required to report that as political activity on their own T3010, leading to a pronounced reluctance to make grants for political activity.</p>
    <p>Lasby acknowledges that opening the data does make it available to people wanting to use it for political capital. Those responsible for instigating the audit process would, however, have had access to the data whether it was open or not. “I don’t know how you avoid [the political use of the data], and frankly I don’t know that you want to avoid that. You would hope that people are informed … and that they make fair points, and that there are lots of voices out there. The challenge there is not, I think, about the data being open or closed, because all that it means is that that contradiction gets played out in a somewhat more public way.” As other commentators have also noted, the audits illustrate that the definitions of political activity may not be clear in practice, or even in law.</p>

    <h3>Mismatch Between Expectations and Reality</h3>
    <p>Without exception, those interviewed about their work with the T3010 data set describe a gap between the apparent promise of the data and what it can actually deliver. Because the T3010 is intended primarily for compliance and administration rather than research, it does not provide all of the information that users would like. It can help give a better high-level view of the financial and human resources of the sector, but has little to say about the clients, networks and funders of charities. Hilary Pearson, President of PFC, notes, in addition, that the T3010 shows where grants came from, but not what they were used for.</p>
    <p>Significantly, the T3010 also says nothing at all about nonprofits without charitable status, which make up nearly half of the sector. Because nonprofit organizations without charitable status are covered by different legislation and legal requirements, they are not required to file an annual return. As a result, relatively little is known about Canadian nonprofits, although they make up at least 44 percent of the nonprofit sector, according to the National Survey of Non-profit and Voluntary Organisations (NSNVO). Brouard notes the absence of a directorate devoted to nonprofits without charitable status: “CRA isn’t interested in nonprofits [without charitable status] because they don’t pay tax.”</p>
    <p>Noting that many of those using the T3010 data set tend to fall in love with its possibilities, and then out of love with it as they encounter its limitations, Lasby cautions that it needs to be treated as a foundation, rather than as a complete source. “If you treat it as a found, high-quality data set you’re pretty much inevitably going to be disappointed. The number of research questions you can answer [without gathering more data] is actually pretty limited. People [think], ‘Oh, there’s this tremendously rich source of data that’s going to answer all my questions!’ Well, no: You’ve got a tremendously rich source of data that can provide you with a framework to work from in going out and gathering more data to answer your questions.” </p>
    <h3>Data Quality: Transcription and Reporting Errors</h3>
    <p>One of the common complaints about the T3010 data is that it is currently manually entered from paper returns without double-keying, increasing the likelihood that transcription errors will occur and not be caught.,, Because data is submitted and keyed de novo each year, rather than being prepopulated, consistency of even the most basic data, such as an organization’s name, is limited, according to Brouard. The 2014 Canadian federal budget committed the government to reducing the administrative burden on charities by introducing electronic filing of T3010s and online applications for registrations for charitable status, at a cost of $1 million in 2014–15 and $0.5 million in 2015–16. Users hope that this will increase the speed and accuracy of the data release.</p>
    <p>Lasby believes reporting errors are a far more significant problem than transcription errors. During the 1990s, it was discovered that some organizations were reporting their financials in thousands of dollars, without indicating the last three zeroes, rather than submitting exact figures. As a result, financial reporting on the T3010 for these organizations was out by three orders of magnitude. Returns from 30 percent of universities studied were affected, resulting in a significant understatement of the size and wealth of the sector. The mistake was able to be identified by comparing the T3010 data against data published by the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, but similar mistakes in reporting by other charities may well have gone uncorrected.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, little is done by CRA to verify the data supplied by charities, making it hard for users to assess data quality. Brouard questions whether some of the data collected is used, or even monitored, by government. “As a charity, you will be penalized if you don’t file your T3010 – but if you file it with garbage, no one seems to really care.” Lasby points out that the T3010 does not have to be audited before filing. “You’ve got something that looks like a financial statement [based on] generally accepted accounting principles … but’s that’s not what it is. It’s not a balance sheet, it’s a self-reported compliance document.”</p>
    <p>The quality of the data set is also affected by the fact that the data is reported by the executive directors and board members of the organizations themselves, who may not have financial or legal expertise. Lasby reports that there have been considerable efforts to train those responsible for completing T3010s – “you name it, it’s been done” – and the form comes with a general guide and accompanying resources on the CRA website, but that ensuring the accuracy of data collection nonetheless remains a challenge. “The stark reality for the sector is that half of the organizations out there are 100 percent volunteer run. In a lot of cases, you’re asking someone who doesn’t necessarily have financial training to fill out a document that looks a lot like a financial document, and a lot of the time they don’t have legal training … and they don’t fully understand … the legal framework around charities.” This is complicated by what Phillips and Lenczner refer to as the lack of a “capacity for numeracy” within the sector. Brouard reports that research units at Carleton had been contracted for projects to help improve compliance among smaller charities, whom CRA had recognized had particular difficulty filling in the T3010 correctly, and who lacked the financial resources to retain accountants to help them.</p>
    <h3>Definitional Challenges</h3>
    <p>Definitional problems are also common, creating confusion for charities and data users alike. Users note that terms used in the form – for fundraising methods and categories of revenue sources, to give two examples – are often different from those in common or academic use, and are not well understood by even the largest and most sophisticated of charitable organizations completing the document, or indeed by government departments. This leads to organizations with similar funding mixes having radically different T3010 reporting, according to Lasby.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the problem is not the definition, but the absence of a definition. Pearson notes that the T3010 does not specify whether assets reported should be book or market value. “For us, that matters a lot. Market value … can be much higher than book, and if we calculate our membership fee as a percentage of assets, if it’s book value then it’s going to be a lot less. But it’s also misleading in reporting in aggregate ways on the value of foundations. Are we underreporting the whole field?” These technical issues have made Pearson wary about depending on T3010 data in making statements about or assessments of the grant-making sector. “The only number that I can say, yes, I am certain that this is a correct number is the number of registered foundations, public and private, because CRA counts them and reports them. [But] even that misses how many of them are active and how many are just sitting on the books.”</p>
    <p>Definitional confusion has implications not just for the quality of data collection, but also for organizational behavior. “The T3010 attempts to ask every charity what percentage of your budget, itemized, goes into administration [and] what percent goes into charitable activity, and an awful lot of charities out there are confused about that. In spite of CRA’s attempts to explain what is administrative and what is charitable, it’s not clear. Just about the only thing that does seem to be clear is that the fee you pay to your auditor for auditing your financial statements is an administrative expense. An awful lot of foundations still think that they have to put all their salaries into the administrative expense box, and therefore they don’t hire people … because they don’t want to have any overhead.”  </p>
    <h3>Shifting Government Priorities</h3>
    <p>The T3010 has also changed over time in response to changes in government priorities. Having requested archival data since 2000, Brouard found himself frustrated by the frequent changes in the form to reflect changes in tax policy, which made it difficult, and in some cases impossible, to compare data over time. Some of the changes seem arbitrary and designed to confuse rather than enlighten. Brouard cites a change in the wording of a question that asked one year whether an organization was active, and whether the organization was inactive in the following year’s form. “So a yes one year means a no in another year.” Changes to the form are also accompanied by a temporary drop in data quality, according to Lasby: “Every single time we change the form, data quality suffers, and then as that section of the form becomes more and more familiar … data quality gets better.” Brouard suggests that assistance from Statistics Canada could help to improve the design of the T3010, but that communication between Statistics Canada and the Canada Revenue Agency is poor, although efforts have been made to improve them.</p>
    <p>Those seeking to use the data must therefore either accept its imperfections or find ways to eliminate erroneous or questionable data. Lasby notes that academic and research use requires substantial time and effort to clean the data and ensure data from the subset of charities under study is coherent, free from obvious error, and meets necessary criteria. Imagine Canada and Ajah have found ways to circumvent these problems, at least in part, by combining the T3010 data set with data from other sources. According to Lasby, however, there are few tools to assist those attempting to work with the T3010 data, and becoming conversant with it and skilled in its use is a time- and labor-intensive exercise in self-teaching. “The principal [question is], whether you have the systems in place to work with the data? Do you have the technological infrastructure to make use of it? ... Only a minority of people have the skills required to work with it directly, and the technology does not yet exist, or is not yet widespread, to allow folks who lack those technical skills to work with it.” Brouard puts it more succinctly: “It’s one thing to have the data; it’s another to be able to work with it easily.”</p>
  looking_forward: >
    <h3>Improving the Usability of the Data</h3>
    <p>Users are equivocal about the usefulness of the current T3010 data release on the government’s open data portal. Lasby says that some of the ways the data has been processed for release on the open data portal do not make sense to him, and make the data harder to work with. He prefers to get data updates on CD-ROM, which are more frequent, with disc releases taking place roughly once a month, and containing a couple of years’ worth of both newly released data and updates and corrections to previously released data. CRA has expressed interest in creating an official research database, which Elson believes would be a boon for the comparability of research, but Lasby is concerned that accuracy would suffer without the continual updating of the CD-ROM releases. </p>
    <p>Some parts of the data set remain largely unexplored territory. Lenczner notes that no one has made much use of the newly complete records of charitable gifts, since the entire list of gifts has only been made available since 2013. Overall, he believes that there is still a lot of value to be extracted from the entire data set. “It takes time for innovation to happen. It takes the market knowing what’s available and people knowing how to exploit what’s available.” Lasby believes the use of the data is increasing as its availability has become better known. “One of the changes I’ve observed over the past couple of years is more and more journalists working with it, as a completely standard thing … and they work with it as a data set, not [by] going in and looking at a single organization.”</p>
    <p>Both Pearson and Brouard believe that separating the regulation of charities from tax collection would improve data quality and coverage. Pearson suggests that the solution may ultimately lie in separating the collection of charities data from CRA. “I think the fundamental issue … is one that the U.K. tackled some time ago: Should the regulation of the sector be handled out of the [tax] department? The U.K. created the Charities Commission for very good reason. An independent organization is able to regulate and collect data on charities outside of the requirements of revenue collection. I think that’s really fundamental, but that’s not an issue for CRA: It’s a political issue, and a policy issue.”</p>
    <h3>IT Support for Nonprofits</h3>
    <p>There are several indications that Canada will be furthering its leadership in this space. The already launched Non-Profit Organization Risk Identification Project Report should increase public knowledge about the significant number of nonprofits that do not have charitable status. Additionally, the announced IT Modernization Charities project – which is aimed at modernizing the CRA’s IT systems so that it can provide new electronic service options for charities – contains several measures to improve the quality and availability of that data. Those initiatives, as well as civil initiatives such as the Community Knowledge Exchange and Ajah’s own PoweredbyData, give Canada the opportunity to continue to develop its expertise in this area.</p>
    <h3>Nonprofit Data Collaboratives</h3>
    <p>As openness in the Canadian nonprofit sector continues to take hold, actors in the field should look to not only move toward compliance and transparency, but consider how data can enable greater collaboration among organizations. As David Eaves argued prior to the release of nonprofit data in 2013:</p>
    <p>“[T]here is a tremendous opportunity in the nonprofit space around not just using data, but also sharing data, to better understand some of the world's toughest challenges. I'm also left acknowledging that even where data usage is strong – such as in the environmental community – few stakeholders in these sectors see open data as something relevant or meaningful to their organizations and their strategies. I'm not sure how to change that, but it seems like a huge opportunity.”</p>
    <p>The Community Knowledge Exchange Summit, for instance, demonstrates the interest in and potential impacts of greater coordination between actors in the Canadian nonprofit space. One of the key aspects of the summit was field building: “Creating and holding a space for community organizations, academic and research institutions, governments, funders and grant-makers, and engaged citizens to come together in the spirit of collaboration and openness.”</p>
    <p>It has been evident in many cases in this selection of case studies that data collaboratives bringing together actors within and across sectors can amplify the impacts of open data. Now that the proverbial cat is out of the bag, and open data is the default in the nonprofit sector, organizations can start to consider how they can turn this openness into new ways to solve problems together.</p>

  summary: >
    <p>In 2004, the Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General (CGU) created the Transparency Portal, a tool that aims to increase fiscal transparency of the Brazilian Federal Government through open government budget data. Developed in partnership with the Federal Data Processing Service, the Transparency Portal relies on the collaboration of diverse ministries and bodies of the Federal Public Administration to advance transparency and to offer a tool that stimulates citizen participation. As the quality and quantity of data on the portal have improved over the past decade, the Transparency Portal is now one of the country’s primary anti-corruption tools, registering an average of 900,000 unique visitors each month. The project is regarded as one of the most important e-government initiatives with regard to control over public spending. Local governments throughout Brazil and three other Latin American countries have modeled similar financial transparency initiatives after Brazil’s Transparency Portal.</p>
  takeaways: >
    <p>Key takeaways:</p>
    <ul class="small m-show">
      <li>Open data initiatives can help uncover illegal or irresponsible government spending, engage citizens in anti-corruption campaigns, and lead to meaningful public policy changes that might not occur without the public outrage created by disclosure.</li>
      <li>Anonymous feedback channels are an important way to supplement existing government-maintained databases, especially those focused on corruption. Giving whistleblowers a platform for sharing information can lead to more comprehensive corruption data – although the risk of false positives should not be overlooked.</li>
      <li>Some information, such as in-depth budgetary data, might require some level of translation to make it truly accessible and useful to average citizens in terms of technological availability and comprehensibility. Additional efforts, of course, must be made to ensure that any personally identifiable financial information is anonymized before being made public. </li>

    <h3>Corruption in Brazil</h3>
    <p>As with many of the countries included in this series, Brazil has long suffered from corruption. The country is ranked 69 among 175 countries in Transparency International’s 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index, which also reports that the country’s legal system is <a href="#reference-2" data-open="#reference-2">“plagued with inefficiencies and corrupt judges.”<sup>2</sup></a> Brazilian elections are also believed to be infiltrated by corruption and, despite public outrage, politicians with prior convictions are often voted back to office. In Rio de Janeiro, for example, Brazil’s third-largest state with a <a href="#reference-3" data-open="#reference-3">population of 11.9 million as of 2012,<sup>3</sup></a> “only one single politician in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro is said to have never fallen foul of the law,” according to <a href="#" data-open="#reference-4">one news report.<sup>4</sup></a> Additionally, a 2009 World Bank and IFC1 Enterprise Survey found that 70 percent of global and domestic companies viewed corruption as a “major constraint to doing business” in Brazil, while a Federation of the Industries of the state of São Paulo investigation found that corruption cost Brazil <a href="#" data-open="#reference-5">almost $40 billion (about 2.3 percent of GDP) in 2008 alone.<sup>5</sup></a></p>
    <p>Somewhat paradoxically, Brazil is often cited for its strong legal framework aimed at limiting corruption, and is considered a role model among developing countries in terms of its legal and regulatory efforts. While the Penal Code criminalizes the embezzlement of public funds, extortion, public graft, breach of public duty and bribery (passive and active), a 2014 anti-bribery law makes companies liable for acts of corruption committed by their employees. The law applies to the bribing of domestic and foreign officials, and convicted companies must pay a fine of up to 20 percent of their gross annual income and may also face <a href="#" data-open="#reference-6">suspension of operations, confiscation of assets, or closure.<sup>6</sup></a></p>
    <p>Yet despite these formal mechanisms, corruption has proven deep-rooted and difficult to eradicate.

    <h3>Open Data in Brazil</h3>
    <p>Brazil is a co-founder of the Open Government Partnership, along with Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, Philippines, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. The government has committed itself to actively developing initiatives that encourage citizen participation in government, and to using technology to create and promote openness. These efforts are led by the National Infrastructure Open Data (INDA), which aims to establish open data technical standards (i.e., common formats and machine-readable metadata, etc.), promote training, and <a href="#" data-open="#reference-8">support and encourage government publication of open data.<sup>8</sup></a></p>
    <p>Some of the open data efforts undertaken by the government include: </p>
    <ul class="small"><li>The implementation of Brazil’s Access to Information Law in 2011. This law regulates citizens’ access to federal, state, provincial and municipal public documents, as <a href="#" data-open="#reference-9">formally guaranteed by the 1988 Constitution.<sup>9</sup></a></li>
    <li>The Open Data Portal (described further below) was launched in 2012 to provide citizens with a <a href="#" data-open="#reference-10">tool to find and use public information.<sup>10</sup></a></li></ul>
    <li>A nationwide conference on transparency (CONSOCIAL) was organized in 2012, involving more than 100,000 Brazilians and providing for a national platform to debate issues relating to transparency,  <a href="#" data-open="#reference-11">citizen participation in public administration, and the fight against corruption.<sup>11</sup></a></li></ul>
    <li>A Freedom of Information Law was passed in 2012. While the law has notable advantages – like its applicability to all levels of government, unlike freedom of information laws in other countries – <a href="#" data-open="#reference-12">“there is still no set of regulations detailing how citizens can ask for data, and what municipal, state or federal officials must do to comply.”<sup>12</sup></a></li></ul>
    <p>In fact, the legal basis for these efforts can be dated back to 1988, when the country’s constitution established the need for “publicity” of administrative actions as one of its five core principles. The constitution also provides for direct citizen participation in overseeing public policies on health, social security and welfare; and freedom of speech and freedom of the press. A 2000 law on fiscal responsibility solidified the government’s commitment to openness, mandating the public availability of key budget documents.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, despite these legal mechanisms to ensure openness, public access to government data was patchy (at best), and scope for citizen participation in government oversight was somewhat limited for much of Brazil’s recent history. The launch of Brazil’s Transparency Portal in 2004 marked the country’s first concrete steps toward true openness and hopefully,  <a href="#" data-open="#reference-13">true government accountability.<sup>13</sup></a></p>
  project: >
    <p>Over the course of the 2002 presidential campaign, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (known as “Lula”) ran as an outsider to the political system and made a number of promises to fight corruption and improve transparency. Almost immediately after he took office, civil society groups (and other organizations and even some government agencies) began putting pressure on him to fulfill those promises.</p>
    <p>In 2003, the post of the Comptroller General of Brazil (<i>Controladoria-Geral da União</i> – CGU) was established; the CGU was an office close to the presidency and was mandated to be in charge of transparency. CGU Chief Minister Walder Pires (also known as the Minister of Control and Transparency) began pushing for several anti-corruption measures, including one to provide transparency on federal government spending. His team, headed by Jorge Hage, was assigned the responsibility for implementing this last initiative. </p>
    <p>One of Hage’s first suggestions was to open data that was already being compiled by the Ministry of Finance and kept in an Integrated System of Financial Administration (SIAFI). This system, which was not accessible to the public, contained fiscal information related to federal transfers to states and municipalities as well as information on funds directly received from public resources (for example, payments from entities with government contracts). However, the Head of Treasury at the time, Joaquim Levy, opposed the idea of opening SIAFI data, arguing that the information was stored in a format and manner that would be too technical for citizens to properly use or understand. According to Leodelma de Marilac Felix, then head of the General Auditing Coordination at the Ministry of Finance, which was in charge of the SIAFI data, Hage’s desire to open up the data was otherwise received enthusiastically, and the key issue was finding a way to make it more accessible and usable for citizens. <a href="#" data-open="#reference-14">“Most of us involved were very excited. We thought, ‘Great idea,’” said Felix.<sup>14</sup></a></p>
    <p>It was from this need for a more accessible platform that the seeds of the Transparency Portal were planted. At the time, the CGU did not have the technical capacity to create such a portal, so it collaborated with Serpro, a public company linked to the Ministry of Finance, to develop the platform, which would then be maintained by the CGU. According to Izabela Corrêa, CGU Head of Transparency 2007-2012, opening up the data and making it publicly available was a complex process. The data was stored in a wide variety of formats, and was generally quite inaccessible (even many members of Congress had not been allowed to access it). In general, its readability was very poor, and the technical team faced serious challenges in understanding how the system stored the data.</p>
    <p>In June 2003, the CGU set up a working group to study how to extract and combine the data. This working group, which consisted of officials from the CGU, the Secretariat of National Treasury, and the Federal Service of Data Processing, began making some headway, and the result was the Transparency Portal, <a href="#" data-open="#reference-15">launched in November 2004.<sup>15</sup></a> Suggestions provided by citizens via the portal’s “contact us” link and at subsequent portal events were also adopted. The launch of the portal represented a major milestone in Brazil’s move toward openness and transparency. As Waldir Pires, former Minister of Defence, remarked at the time<b>: </b>“With this government project we take an important step toward full transparency of accounts, contributing in effect to societal control over the use of public resources.” </p>
    <h3>Portal Description</h3>
    <p>According to the CGU website, today the portal is “a channel through which citizens can monitor the financial implementation of government programs at the federal level.” The goal is “to increase the transparency of public management, enabling citizens to track and monitor how public money is being used.” Care has been taken to make sure the information contained on the portal is easily accessible to the public, for example without requiring a username or password. In addition, specialized financial information like budgets is presented in a way that is easy for laypeople to analyze and understand. “Many legal and budget-related terms, in particular, are very complicated,” says portal coordinator Otávio Moreira de Castro Neves. “We try to present them in a language and format that the user will understand.”</p>
    <p>The portal’s organizers have also taken numerous steps to engage users and spread awareness about the site and how to use it. The site launch was complemented by TV campaigns and workshops designed to train citizens, reporters and public officials to use the portal. In addition, regular workshops and activities were held, including drawing and essay competitions for adults and children. These outreach activities continue to be well attended, and form an important part of the government’s strategy to engage and involve users in the portal.  </p>
    <p>When initially launched, the portal contained a limited amount of information: data on federal transfers to states and municipalities, payments to the government, information on public servants. Over the years, more information has been added, and today five broad categories of data are published: 1) direct spending by federal government agencies through contracts and tender processes; 2) all financial transfers to states, municipalities and the federal district; 3) financial transfers to social program benefactors; 4) administrative spending, including staff salaries, staff travel expenses and per diems and office expenditures; and 5) information on all government official credit card spending. The final decision on what information to upload rests with the CGU. </p>
    <p>One important component of the portal is a National Debarment List, which highlights contractors to avoid. The list consolidates in one place all companies and individual suppliers that have been sanctioned for acts of corruption or committing fraud, allowing public officials to exercise some discretion before hiring or granting public tenders. As of September 2011, the Debarment List held 5,018 debarred entities. While this tool was designed primarily to be used by public officials, it has also proved useful for private sector entities. However, this component is not without its flaws. As there is no public register of beneficial ownership, it does not prevent corrupt business owners from launching and registering businesses under new names. </p>
    <p><img src="static/img/studies/brazil-0.png" /></p>
    <h5>Figure 1: The National Debarment List</h5>
    <p>As of 2010, the portal also includes two new sections dedicated to information on a couple of major sporting events hosted by Brazil: the 2014 football World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games. Given the large investments in public infrastructure and services involved in these events, the government opted to make all budgetary information available on each project. Information is organized by host city and by interest area, such as arenas, airports and security. </p>
    <p>The CGU has taken care to include feedback channels to involve citizens and allow them to help improve the site’s contents. Every section on the portal includes a survey form or contact link, and there are various ways for whistleblowers to report misconduct or crimes (their identities remain protected). Citizens have used these feedback loops to make suggestions about content on numerous occasions. For instance, citizens and reporters suggested in 2008 that the portal should allow downloads of raw data on administrative agreements between governments and contracted private entities. Similarly, various civil society groups suggested in 2006 that users should be able to search by nonprofit organizations receiving government funds. Both these suggestions were later implemented. Today, data on the portal is updated daily or monthly.</p>
  impact: >
    <p>Brazil’s Transparency Portal has been widely hailed as a successful example of using open data to reduce corruption and control public spending. Over the years, it has received numerous awards and forms of recognition, including the 2007 Brazilian IT and Government award (e-Democracy category). In addition, it was presented as a Best Practice case study at the 2008 Meeting of the UN Convention against Corruption in Bali; the 2009 Transparency Initiative Conference on International Aid in the Netherlands; and the 2009 Third European Meeting on Anti-Corruption in Brussels. </p>
    <p>The portal’s impact can be measured in several ways:</p>
    <h3>Traffic</h3>
    <p>Immediately after its inception, in 2004, the portal registered an average of 410,000 monthly visits from around 10,000 unique visitors. By 2012, the number of unique monthly users rose to 336,512; today, the site receives over 900,000 unique visitors per month., The dramatic rise in traffic is a clear indication of the site’s relevance and importance in Brazilian public life.</p>
    <h3>Policy Changes: Official Credit Card Usage</h3>
    <p>Several<b> </b>changes in the way government operates have directly resulted from information contained on the portal.<b> </b>For example,<b> </b>after<b> </b>the<b> </b>CGU began publishing data on government credit card use, the media began publishing articles on questionable transactions, and this led to a series of scandals. In one instance, the reports led to the resignation of Matilde Ribeiro, Minister of Promotion of Racial Equality. </p>
    <p>Perhaps most importantly, the publication of credit card data led almost immediately to a 25 percent reduction in spending by officials on government cards. In addition, the scandals and rising public awareness led to several changes in credit card policy, including legislation banning the use of cards for payment of travel or per diems; and restrictions on cash withdrawals using official cards (except in very particular situations, for example when an official was located deep in the Amazon, where credit cards are not often accepted).,</p>
    <p>The Transparency Portal has become a tremendous resource for journalists and media, as well as activist groups investigating corruption. These developments further expand the portal’s impact. For example, citizen-group São Paulo Perl Mongers created “Where did my money go?” – a website that presents the portal’s data on government spending in a simplified, heavily visual format. Meanwhile, the group Open Accounts has been providing Brazilian media with training on how to use the portal, helping them publish stories that “often generate public outrage and a swift official response,” such as in 2011, when a story on some government officials’ improper credit card use led to an internal investigation. A government minister eventually was forced to repay $30,000 for “inappropriately charging personal expenses, including vacation travel, to the government.”</p>
    <h3>Local and Cross-Border Dissemination </h3>
    <p>As with many of the case studies in this series, the success of Brazil’s federal portal has a spillover effect on other governments. In Brazil itself, pressure grew for other levels of government to publish budgetary data, and in 2009, a law was passed requiring that local governments have their own versions of the portal. Today, a large part of CGU’s work consists of helping local governments (smaller towns and cities in particular) implement this directive.</p>
    <p>Brazil’s portal has also had reverberations across Latin America. Many countries expressed interest in the portal early on, and since its inception, at least three – Mexico, Chile and El Salvador – have implemented similar projects, often with assistance from Brazil’s CGU. Mexico’s open data portal (<u>www.catalogo.datos.gob.mx</u>) was launched in October 2013. El Salvador created a similar Fiscal Transparency website (<u>www.transparenciafiscal.gob.sv</u>), and Chile has pushed for greater transparency and openness through its own portal (<u><a href="http://datos.gob.cl/" rel="nofollow">http://datos.gob.cl/</a></u>). Overall, Brazil’s model – and in particular its success – has had a broad impact on Latin America, providing powerful evidence of open data’s ability to effect real social, economic and political change.</p>
    <h3>Changing Climate for Corruption</h3>
    <p>The Transparency Portal’s launch and evolution have taken place within a broader trend of rising intolerance for corruption in Brazil. The 2012 convictions in the country’s Mensalao scandal, and prosecutors’ willingness to target top officials in the Petrobras scandal, both indicate a possible end to a climate of impunity for corrupt officials. This welcome trend cannot, of course, be directly attributed to the Transparency Portal; it is the result of a number of changes in Brazilian society and politics. But the launch and widespread use of the portal can be considered both a result of Brazil’s movement toward greater transparency, as well as one of the dynamic forces continuing to nudge the movement forward today.</p>
    <p>The portal also enables internal corruption monitoring that may not have been possible, or as swift, as before. In 2008 CGU created a team of analysts, The Public Spending Observatory, to proactively comb through the portal (and other government databases) to identify “suspicious patterns.” By creating a team dedicated to identifying corruption, the CGU has ensured that the information housed on the portal will be put to use, whether or not the general public maintains their current level of interest in accessing the portal’s data. </p>
    <p>In March of 2015, Transparency International stated that Brazil “has made good progress in the past three years passing key anti-corruption laws” (while noting that enforcement of these laws have been limited and that corruption is still a problem). Or, as CGU Chief Minister Jorge Hage put it in an interview four years earlier, “Here in Brazil, despite much that has been done in recent years, much remains to be done.”</p>
    <p><img src="static/img/studies/brazil-0.png" /></p>
    <h5>Figure 2: The Brazilian Transparency Portal’s Section Dedicated to the 2014 World Cup</h5>
  challenges: >
    <p>Despite its generally positive reaction and relative success, the Transparency Portal, like many projects included in this series of open data impact case studies, has and continues to face some hurdles to further growth. Three challenges, in particular, are worth examining more closely:</p>
    <h3>Interoperability and Data Standards</h3>
    <p>As with any new platform, the Transparency Portal deals with several “legacy” issues concerning the way information has historically been collected, stored and disseminated in Brazil. One of its most acute challenges has been to assemble data from various government agencies and present that data in a cohesive, unified manner. This applies most acutely to legacy data, but even for more recent information, CGU officials have had to negotiate with officials and agencies over the manner in which their data is collected and shared. Dealing with such a variety of data formats and systems not only slows down the process, it also increases the risk of introducing errors. As Otávio Moreira de Castro Neves, Coordinator for Open Government and Transparency, puts it: “As we put data up online we are constantly under the risk of human error, or under the risk of delays. So we have to keep a tight grip on this.”</p>
    <p>Leodelma de Marilac Felix, Finance and Control Analyst at the Transparency and Public Oversight Directorate, provides some examples of the types of errors CGU must work to prevent. He cites the (hypothetical) example of a bank deciding to change a particular data field (e.g., the way a date is stored) in its data sets, but doing so without informing CGU. According to Felix, it can take CGU up to four months to identify the problem.</p>
    <p>Such issues are not insurmountable, nor are they unique to the Transparency Portal. For example, CGU is now looking into changing its application rules for how information is received; this could help standardize data. Still, CGU is unlikely to be able to ever fully resolve the issue, and as with most data systems and projects, some degree of error-checking and validation will always be required. However, making the data accessible increases the likelihood that data errors will be corrected, as more people will be using the data, and using it more often, than before. “These are not huge challenges. We can overcome them,” says Izabela Corrêa, former Coordinator for the Promotion of Ethics, Transparency and Integrity, at Brazil’s Directorate for Corruption Prevention. “But they are always there. Always.” </p>
    <h3>Privacy</h3>
    <p>The need to protect privacy has been a constant, and delicate, issue for the portal. Portal officials report that a large number of the complaints they receive pertain to privacy issues. For instance, more than 100 legal actions were placed against the portal for the publication of public servant salaries; the issue made its way to Brazil’s supreme court, which eventually ruled in favor of the portal. Portal officials also receive a deluge of emails from public servants whose data shows up on Google; even when such officials realize they can’t be removed from the portal, they request portal staff to help them remove their names from Google. </p>
    <p>One major issue pertained to the publication of data sets related to government real estate. This information was put up because public servant occupation of real estate is subject to numerous rules – related, for instance, to officials’ actual titles and posting – and the portal wanted to provide citizens with information that would help them oversee that the rules were being followed. However, the problem was that publishing real estate data inadvertently revealed the addresses of public officials, which not only violated their privacy but also potentially threatened their security. CGU eventually dealt with this issue by publishing two separate data sets – one with names, and the other with addresses. </p>
    <h3>Scaling </h3>
    <p>A final challenge relates to the scaling and wider dissemination of the platform. As mentioned previously, a 2009 law required various regional governments in Brazil to implement a version of the portal. There have been many hiccups in the implementation of this law. A 2011 study by the <i>Instituto de Estudos Socioeconômicos</i> (INESC), a nonprofit focused on “strengthening civil society and enhancing social participation in public policymaking,” looked at whether local governments were actually opening up data in accordance with the law and with open data principles. While the study found that the data provided was mostly complete, it was often not primary (meaning that the data was not directly sourced by the government) and frequently not provided in a timely manner.</p>
    <p>The study also found various accessibility problems, including the fact that very few websites actually offered machine-readable data in nonproprietary formats. The overall conclusion of the report was that subnational governments need to work considerably to improve the open data process and make more information available in a citizen-friendly format.</p>
  looking_forward: >
    <p>Since its launch in 2004, the portal has been regularly updated and improved. In general, new features have been added to the site at least once a year. Since 2010, many of the most important data sets, such as those on income and spending, are updated on a daily basis. Other data – including that on money transfers between different levels of government – is updated weekly.</p>
    <p>As new data is added, the portal team has made design improvements to the user interface to make the data easier to interpret. At the moment, CGU officials are working on an entirely new version of the site. This updated version will not only have a fresh design, but it will also have a new structure and be based on a more advanced underlying technical framework that will, among other things, provide for new ways of visualizing data. CGU is also building a new data warehouse, which will be launched in 2016.</p>
    <p>In order to surmount Brazil’s low Internet penetration rates, which stand at around 53 percent and limit the portal’s accessibility, CGU piloted a project to set up information kiosks run by state-owned banks. However, since the costs of this project were deemed too high, CGU is now focusing on overall strategies to bridge the digital divide in Brazil, and is working with various government and nongovernmental partners to achieve this goal.</p>
    <p>These various changes and improvements are likely to enhance the Transparency Portal’s offerings and reach in coming years, building on its initial successes and playing a role in Brazil’s ongoing battle against corruption. Of course the portal is but one of many tools in Brazil’s civic toolbox. But it is an important example of the role that open data – and, more generally, government transparency – can play in transforming political, economic and social life.</p>
